What have you prepared for ww3,"I have been prepping since September. And had a book since 2016 for every underground structure. 

I have alot of stuff, for some reason im not mentioning what i have. However, i did not have enough time to develop location identification skills, long reach torches, portable gear. 
 

I dont have enough time / money for electric bicycle since i dont live far from a bunker, neither that i have the money for solar power cells and generators.

I also lack location identification techniques. I didn't have enough time to get all the skills i need.

Looking for a specific or similar model of canvas water sack that my dad used for survival training back in the early 70's-90's,"Important note: It's actually a canvas sack, not leather like I originally thought.

For many years my dad was involved in extremely intense survival training courses in San Gabriel Valley and the surrounding areas back in the mid 70's, 80's, possibly into the 90's. He said that he got this canteen at a store called Gemco when he was 15, which would have been in 1972. That store apparently shut down.

Well, when we got our beagle about 9 years ago now, she had a problem with chewing on everything. She just so happened to get a hold of that canteen and completely destroyed the threads for the lid, and my dad was pretty upset because apparently there's probably no chance of repairing it or replacing it, so I thought I'd ask here to see if by some miracle someone knows what specific canteen he had or might have information on how to find it.


So here's some of the few details I can recall about this particular water sack:

It had a pointed tip attached to the lid that came off and could pour water through a much smaller hole.
The lid itself was attached to the canteen with a string
It was similar in design to your average Stansport water canteen, with the round body, flat on the front and back, but canvas, without a metal or plastic lining.
It's not a curved banana looking waterskin like so many of the results I got when I was trying to search for it.

As a sidenote, if anyone has a recommendation for a person or company that could potentially recreate this product or make one custom that would also be appreciated.

Apparently we might still have it in storage somewhere, so I'll see if I can't find it at some point and post some reference pics.",0,1644827756,RiseofdaOatmeal,0,1,True,2022-02-14,"looking for a specific or similar model of canvas water sack that my dad used for survival training back in the early 70's-90's important note: it's actually a canvas sack, not leather like i originally thought.

Survival Hack / hydration - drinking pee,"I think all the movies show people starting to drink their own pee once all other resources are depleted.

I just thought of something, like if one is stranded or lost and theres no water sources around and it's likely that rationing is necessary then why not to start thinkin and prepping to drink pee eventually while clean water is around.

so first of all, warm pee is likely more disgusting that pee that's not warm or hot.
So could start collecting pee in advance and try to cool it by digging a hole and storing it there.
but more importantly take time to build a natural filter to i don't know, filter a pee abit perhaps and this will remove some taste?
also when if wild in forest for example then can pick some berries or leaves that sre edible and cook them and add to pee to have better taste.

i understand that when emergency like that then probably don't have time to worry about warmness or taste.

anyway that's a weird ass post

A Prepper Book For Teachers?,"So I picked up a few books recently on prepping because I like to have as much material in paper form as possible for referencing. I picked up:

52 Prepper Projects by David Nash: (8/10) A new project each week. with fun projects. 

The Prepper's Cookbook by Tess Pennington: (9/10) Has great recipes that work with most the types of food preppers stock pile. 

Teach Like A Prepper by Donald Pierce: (9/10) Shows teachers how to be preppers in their classrooms and the rest of the school. 

This last book, Teach Like A Prepper, turned out to be better than I thought. I work in education and it really ave me some great ideas on how to implement some of my prepper skills and practices into the classroom that I didn't think about before. It even had some humor worked into it. I think every teacher should have a copy of the book. It even covers emergency procedures.

the prepper's cookbook by tess pennington: (9/10) has great recipes that work with most the types of food preppers stock pile. 

teach like a prepper by donald pierce: (9/10) shows teachers how to be preppers in their classrooms and the rest of the school. 

this last book, teach like a prepper, turned out to be better than i thought. i work in education and it really ave me some great ideas on how to implement some of my prepper skills and practices into the classroom that i didn't think about before. it even had some humor worked into it. i think every teacher should have a copy of the book. it even covers emergency procedures. if you are looking for a gift for an educator or administrator, i highly recommend this book.

"Help, cant decide between an ALICE pack w/frame vs. A modern design pack for training.","Hi, i'm a scout of over 15 years, and recently i've wanted to do a bit more survival training coupled with some more ""military"" type training (so some firearms, camo, etc)

"If I see you wearing camouflage in the backcountry, I’m going to actively avoid you.","
To me, wearing camo means that you’re:

A. Hunting
B. Doing military things
C. Pretending to do military things
and/or
D. A wierdo


When I am out and about, I am typically with my family or students.
I am not going to risk the health and safety of people for whom I’m responsible to help you, unless it is abundantly clear that you need and want help.

Now I understand that a lot of you are here in this sub from a bushcraft or prepping perspective, and want to be left alone; and that’s great.  We’ll get along just fine (in the sense that we’ll never interact).

But some of you are here to learn about what to do when your camping trip goes wrong; and this is where my point comes into play.

If I’m out and I see someone else in a weird spot (for the sake of an example, let’s say the bottom of a cliff or ravine) I might go check on them, or at least wander over that way and see if they’re moving.  If I get nearby and see them in camo, I’m changing direction, unless I can clearly see a need for help.

So I guess my point is: if you’re doing the camo thing, whatever, cool.  But be prepared to create a clear signal that you need help, if you need help.",0,1643582112,Akski,0,1,True,2022-01-30,"if i see you wearing camouflage in the backcountry, i’m going to actively avoid you.

How can I learn about the no-work food plants of my area? (central TX),"I want to learn what plants produce food but are known to survive well on their own without much watering or tending.

Do I have to scrape some of this magnesium rod onto tender, then strike it with a separate striker to ignite it? 
Or can I just strike it with the metal piece that comes with it to get sparks (like a ferro rod)?

I don't want a fire starter that has to be scraped onto tender, then striked with a separate striker to get flames. 
I'm looking for something that can be striked directly to get hot sparks. 
So, is this purchase right, or should I cancel it?

ISO Advice on which FAK/Survival Kit to purchase,"Hello, 

I am a pregnant woman with minor medical experience (basically none in this current part of my life). I have been AED/CPR/BLS certified in the past as I was once in training to be a 68W (combat medic) in the Army but got medically discharged and never finished training. That was a long time ago and I honestly remember nothing from my training. 

Now I am pregnant and building my baby registry and want to find a kit that will handle everything from boo-boos to emergencies. My family is very active and loves to go hiking &amp; camping, so I'd love to find a kit that I can buy multiple of and keep in the house, cars, etc. Especially since we'll have a baby around now. 

I am also willing to take a First aid, BLS or other trainings to refresh my mind and learn how to use everything in a kit. Ultimately, I just want something that will do what it needs to do; price doesn't matter- quality is most important. 

Here are some I have found, so I'd love advice on which is the best to get within my current options. If anyone reading this knows a thing of two about this type of stuff, I'd love if you could look through my list and provide some expertise. 

Thanks!

"How to Find, Filter and Purify Water for Survival","When you think about water, it seems to be everywhere, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds and our homes where it seems to flow freely and never ending. 

You hear it when your close to a stream or river. You can smell it when it rains. It is everywhere. 

The importance of water is inevitably the most needed item in any type of survival situation. It is your life line.

# Finding Water

During any survival situation the first thing you must do is to stay calm and access the situation. The second most important thing to do is to find water.

With water being your life line, you must have it and if you don’t have it you must find it. Finding water is really a simple common sense. Water always flows down hill. It stands in basins or deep concave area’s. Runs through ravines, crevices and other naturally formed down hill free flowing terrain.

Any water collected from streams and ponds, rivers or lakes must be filtered and purified before consuming. Do not let yourself slip up and believe that *“well, a little bit won’t hurt anything”*. That is the furthest thing from the truth. Water born bacteria, viruses and protozoans along with heavy minerals and metals and other garbage can make you extremely sick and can lead to death if not treated.

Water looks beautiful but is very deceiving. Rule of thumb, if you can’t see or you don’t know where it comes from then it must be filtered and purified, simple as that. Just because it comes from a spring under ground does not mean it is safe to drink. Always filter and purify unknown water sources.

# Ways to Find Water

One of the fastest ways to find water is to find and follow an animal trail. They always *(high percentage)* lead to or from water. It may be a mile away but it will get you to water. Seeing lush green shrubs and grasses usually always means water is close by too. Cattails are a tell tale sign of water.

Sometimes the water may not be visible above ground but by digging a small hole in the thick grasses or lush shrub, the hole will slowly fill partially with water. Sometimes you may have to dig 2 feet down and sometimes only a few inches. This water will need to be filtered and purified before drinking.

Another option is if the ground is warm and the air cool you can collect dew from leaves and other shrubs. Hanging a plastic bag on a tree branch that is thick with fresh green leaves will collect the moisture in the bag which will stay in the bag and then its there for you to drink without having to purify it. This is called solar distilling for water.

There are many ways of finding or collecting water. The most important thing to remember is to always filter and purify it before consuming any unknown water source. Being hydrated is important but if you consume dirty or bacteria filled water I can tell you this, it will be worse than being just dehydrated. You can become disoriented, very sick, diarrhea and other symptoms that include headache, blurred vision and other things that can and will ruin any chance of survival.

Remember this, *“it’s better to be safe than to be sorry”*. Live by that motto and your chances for survival and successful rescue are in your favor.

# Filtration and Purification

*How do I filter or purify water to drink?*

I hear that question more than any other in the world of survival. By all means, it is an excellent question but I also believe it should be something everyone should have already known or been taught at some point during their school and education process.

Water is so important but everyone really has become so numb in realizing how very important it truly is. We all take it for granted that when we turn the faucet on water will flow and when we jump in the shower the water will be warm and cleansing. We as human beings waste more water than any other product in the world.

Ok, so back to the subject at hand, filtering and purifying water. Simply put, if you don’t know where the water comes from in a survival situation, it is clearly best if it is filtered and purified for safety sake no matter what. Water carries bacteria, viruses, protozoans and other unhealthy things that can and will make you extremely sick and dehydrated and can sometimes cause death if not treated properly...

Apocalypse? Winter dooms day? Technology?,"Many people think of survival gear to be stupid / crazy. I think people are not aware that everything can change upside down in minutes.

Anyway, enough with rant, also i dont tell people in my circle about what i have for survival (obvious reasons)

So emergency blankets. Are they reflective against radiation? Also it may sound funny but this stuff is kinda pure foil and first thing i come across it is to reflective tactically against radiation and extreme weather.

Also water purification. There are many online water purification kits and tablets but the marketing is very poor that made me rethink to buy any. The items are marketed with a hot model sipping pure water on yacht (comical adverts for survival kits)

Lately. I found out that emails can be sent through radio waves (no Internet needed at all) it may take 3 minutes tho to send couple of sentences. However you can also receive news updates online from all emergency channels. The technology is very very sophisticated and been working on it with no success. And yeh before anonymity fanatics step in (JUST NO). this is designed to be traceable and tracked in case of sos. 

So are there any recommendations for a solid water proof survival radio (im not looking for something fancy or for everyday use)

New Year gift," **Amazing New Years Resolutions gift**

 I bought this one and the Skylite 2.0 there was so many to choose from, and reviews all over the place for all of them. 

 The light is very intriguing and captures the attention of audiences of all ages. You can customize the light to the color options you wish to see and can customize the motor to keep it still or put it in motion as if you’re looking at a beautiful moving supernova in the galaxy. The sleep timer is good because it can serve as a night light and it saves battery. I like the fact that it’s rechargeable. The stand is also adjustable to give a wider view and different angles. It also has adjustable brightness which is good at night. 

 Having a magnate base is really nice so you are unlimited in positioning.  
Touch buttons are exactly that... very easy to hit the power button when moving it. the remote is very useful and worked as intended. Over all its a descent unit. if its bright in the room use the read, if its dark use the green. Use both for Christmas..

Sleeping on top of a Dakota Firehole is actually a really good way to stay warm through the night .,"I recently went out on a primitive camping trip where I knew the temps were going to be below freezing in night. I had little more than a wool blanket for bedding, so I decided to try an idea I've been contemplating for a long time, but have never seen anybody else use--and which worked amazingly well. I absolutely love Dakota fireholes for camping. They're low-impact, incredibly fuel-efficient, produce little smoke, are much safer than an open fire in dry conditions, and are great for cooking over. But after a trip to Japan last year, I wondered if they could be used in another way, similar to a traditional kotatsu. A [kotatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu) is a piece of furniture that combines a low table with a warm, insulative skirt--think a coffee table with a blanket for a table cloth. These days they use an electric heater set into the underside of the table, but before electric heating was an option they used a small metal pit set into the floor under the table filled with burning charcoal. This seems like an idea with some drawbacks indoors, namely carbon monoxide and fire hazard, but it got me thinking about its usefulness when camping--could you just sleep on top of a Dakota firehole that had burned down to coals? So on this last trip, after digging [my firehole and kindling a fire](https://preview.redd.it/7h03n9i240461.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3f2c53668b84228350e105c9f455aa1e720b6ed), I burned as much hardwood as I could over the course of a few hours before dark. This produced a nice bed of coals at the bottom of the pit, about 6"" (15cm) deep in my 8""-ish (20cm) wide hole. That may not seem like much for hours of burning, but remember that this is a very small, efficient fire. Come nightfall, I just...lay down on top of that bad boy, with the hole directly between my thighs and a wool blanket over the top of me. It worked GREAT. I was warm all night, sleeping in the open in sub-freezing temperatures. It was downright hot at first, but as the coals were blanketed with ash, they cooled from lack of airflow, and I was able to close my legs over the hole without burning the backs of my thighs. Eventually, the ash got thick enough that heat production slowed down and I started feeling chilly. I sat up, stirred the hole with a stick to bring fresh coals to the fresh air at the surface, and the cycle repeated. I had to stir the hole about once every 3 hours, an operation which took 30 seconds, max, and unlike rekindling or even just stoking a fire it took no finesse or concentration. I barely had to wake up to do it. That plume of heat coming up directly between your femoral arteries keeps your feet in particular nice and toasty. A few caveats: Obviously, the fire should be burned down to coals, but even ‏‏‎ so this is best done with a wool blanket if possible, since nylon or polyester are very, very bad news when they catch fire or even just melt. Also, don't stick your head under the blanket or do this in an enclosed shelter--carbon monoxide is a real risk. Some folks have suggested digging a long pit, building a fire in it, burying it come nightfall and sleeping over that--but that would require excavating several dozen times as much dirt as digging a firehole, building a much bigger fire, moving all that dirt *again* to re-bury it, and would only be good for a single night--you'd have to re-dig it all over again the next day. The firehole, conversely, is extremely re-useable. Other folks have suggested just sleeping with a hot water bottle, but as high as the specific heat capacity of water is, you'd need about 45 liters/12 gallons of boiling-temp water to give off the same amount of heat as the small volume of charcoal I had in the bottom of my pit. Future avenues of research could be figuring out how to make this work with a raised bed platform, since the cold ground is the biggest source of heat loss with this technique. I laid down a pallet of rushes as an attempt at some small insulation, but with little success.

So how difficult would building a raft be?,"Scenario- You are one person stranded on an island with trees. You have little hope of a ship/aircraft spotting you so decide to make a raft and sail out like in the movies. You have no knowledge of raft-making other than movies and maybe a couple of documentaries. Maybe you also read an internet article on it 5 years ago.

Where do you even start? How do you cut down trees to obtain logs? Or do you look for fallen logs? Would it matter what tree the logs are from and what if they are all different sizes?

where do you even start? how do you cut down trees to obtain logs? or do you look for fallen logs? would it matter what tree the logs are from and what if they are all different sizes? how do you tie them together if you have no rope? how much energy is this going to take and can you afford to use that energy if you are hungry? how do you know the thing won't fall apart when the sea gets rough? what if your raft takes you out to the open ocean and you're just stranded in the middle of nowhere in the ocean? you are probably less likely to be found in a random spot in the ocean and if the tide does take you to land what if it's another uninhabited island?"

Looking to sleep out of my car in the mountains for a ski season...,"Hey everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster.

I live in Denver, Colorado and want to ski as much as possible this winter. Hotels or AirBnBs are not an option. I think the most nights consecutive I'd sleep out of my car would probably be 5-7, depending how comfortable my set up is. I can go back to my warm bed in Denver whenever I please. I would be staying in the rocky mountains in well populated cities such as Frisco, Keystone, Breckenridge, Copper, Vail, etc.

Things I have figured out so far...

* Camping grill and other similar items. I am an experienced camper.
* I am looking into proper sleeping bags.
* I know safe places I can park and sleep in my car.
* I have thick blankets, socks, other winter gear.

What more tips would y'all have? 

Thanks!!!

*Edit: Thank y’all so much for all the tips. Can’t reply to everyone, been busy. But it’s honestly been soooooo helpful.

*Edit if anyone is still commenting: I think based on the information given by you lovely folk, a practical strategy for me would be to do 2-3 nights at a time.

Non-essential “survival” items for your survival kit,"A survival situation is sometimes more than just physically staying alive. While your physical well-being might rely on a box of matches, shelter, paracord, etc, what is something you’d want to lift your spirits? Survival can also be a mental game (loss of another’s life, hopelessness, loneliness, etc.)

I’ve been in several intense survival situations and while I had the supplies I needed to get warmth, shelter, and food, I learned other things were almost as valuable to stay sane. For me. This is 100% personal.

Here are the non-essential items I keep in my survival kit.

1) pencil and 2”x3” notebook. I like to write, sketch, plan, etc. this takes virtually no space and weighs nothing (and can double as a fire starter if necessary)

2) Excedrin. If you drink coffee everyday like I do, if you are suddenly cut off from it, the withdrawals can be painful and distracting from the survival task at hand. I have excedrin to plan for the withdrawals. This is not medical advice, I’m no medical expert, and it could be considered drug abuse, I don’t know. But it works for me and weighs nothing.

3) Peach gummy candy. Nothing like a short burst of your favorite sugary product to keep you positive.

4) a hair comb. Just the tiny one. I have long hair and a beard and it can get tangled pretty quickly without regular care. For three weeks I was stranded one time, and my hair was such a mess I couldn’t even sleep because it was like laying on a tennis ball. I had to shave my head after the ordeal.

These items are totally non-essential, but for me, have made a world of difference, bringing a little happiness into a life or death situation. 

What are some items you might have in your “survival” stash? A deck of cards? A picture of the family? A harmonica? This is a personal preference and I’m curious to hear what others can’t go without.

Note: I know “survival kits” vary by climate or intention (natural disaster home preparedness kit vs backpacking kit), but I think I’d still choose my personal items across the board of survival scenarios.",0,1639153918,Viojezajanu,132,1,True,2021-12-10,"non-essential “survival” items for your survival kit a survival situation is sometimes more than just physically staying alive. while your physical well-being might rely on a box of matches, shelter, paracord, etc, what is something you’d want to lift your spirits? survival can also be a mental game (loss of another’s life, hopelessness, loneliness, etc.)

Looking for good rain protection.,"Hello guys!

As you read from the title, I am looking for new rain protection.

I kinda hate those plastic-like raincoats. I alwqys have one in my backpack, but in case of rain I literally never use them. Why? Because I am literally boiling in them. High temperatures and heavy sweating make me nervous a lot and when I am in wilderness I like to be cool. When I wear those plastic-like hiking raincoats I end up being wet from sweat as much as I would be from rain if I didn't wear them.

So I planned to maybe start using plash palatka (basically russian tent-raincoat). You can use it as a one-man shelter, in combination with other ones for making bigger tents and of course (for what I need it) as a raincoat (which on photos looks just amazing).

Since I found out that Romanian plash palatka has holes for two hands, I thought of getting that one.

Do you have any experience with it? Is it good as a protection from rain?
Is Romanian one good/bad? Is the Russian one better/worse?
Will I have overheating problems like with those plastic raincoats?
Is it too heavy?
Is it too big? 

And besides that I found this link on google and I have never used this site before. What do you think about the site? Is it safe? Have you used it before? Do you have something I should have in mind? Do you know any better place to buy plash palatka?
https://www.militarysurplus.eu/product-eng-39927-Romanian-Plash-palatka-rain-cape-shelter-half-surplus-Olive-1-80x1-80m.html

If not palatka, then what would you suggest me? Maybe poncho of some military unit or something?
I kinda don't want to spend more than 30€ this time.

I am really looking forward your replies.

Where can I find survival resources for a medieval walkabout?,"This is by far the nerdiest and lamest thing I've ever done, but I'm wanting to do a day hike in the national park nearby during the first snow.

a possible method to un-distill water,"it's easy enough to get distilled water, but not safe to drink for a long period of time. here's my proposed method to put nutrients back into it.

basically strain the water through soil, like a container full of soil, with a hole in the bottom, and another container under it to catch the water which would theoretically be not distilled. maybe boil it after if there's bacteria in the soil.

Life Guide：A letter from a survivalist group in China.,"In China, there is also a fake reddit software called post bar. In this software, there is a community that studies how to survive in a crisis like here, with about 300000 people.

I will tell you the information from CN and sort out a lot of materials you can use for you.

The bad news is that you must secretly prepare a lot of bullets and guns. Each person has at least 10000 bullets and at least 10 long guns. In this way, we can survive the next nationwide Rittenhouse and 0 yuan purchase. Also, prepare two years of food and water toilet paper. Don't go out. I hope you're still alive next time.

Why can’t they station one ranger/outpost or water station per 10-15 square miles?,"Death Valley is only 5,100 or so square miles, only about a fraction of that area is ground hikers can walk on, and do not include the tops of mountains or steep slopes.

And if they are only ten miles apart, even on the hottest day a person can walk from one side to another.

Add a few ladders or bridges to more obscure places, and leave some remote areas unmanned but visit every few days, perhaps leave a beacon.

Some patrols could be established every 24 hours. This would essentially prevent any tragedy like the German family from happening. They died on the bottom of a wash I believe. It looks pretty big in area. If even one outpost was there it would be likely noticeable enough to save lives.

I need some advice on a diy hot tent build (Poly Tarp),"So i want to build a hot ten, and i have a massive poly tarp.. like... the cheap blue $20 plastic ones from Canadian Tire... 

Anyway, im planning on making a tp style hot tent with it but what im concerned about is the material...

So after i get the shape, i was planning on cutting out a square for the chimney, and a larger square at the bottom where a diy paint or coffee can wood stove would go, and replace the material in both areas with either real wool, or a fire/resistant material of any kind...

any way, thats all easy enough, and i know that a thin plastic tarp wont keep the heat in too well, but ive dealt with worse with good results and worst comes to worse, ill line it with some space blankets... 

now what concerns me the most, and since google is just sending me mixed messages... does this sound at least half ass safe? last thing i want to do is have melting plastic dripping on me, or wake up in sub temperatures with no shelter or, god forbid (for real) a forest fire....

Im pretty handy so there wont be any actual design flaws... but have any of you got any experience with this? is this just a stupid idea?, any horror stories? or am i just over thinking this?... any information anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated, along with any advise or tips... Please dont bother with any passive aggressive paragraphs or condescending comments cuz i know how reddit could be sometimes but theres a reason im asking... I just want to learn, and trying to make someone feel like an idiot helps nothing... I know theres probably a keyboard warrior just itching at the finger tips but please just be civil...

"if you dig a hole into the snow for a makeshift cave in a hurry, where do you position the fire?","i am making a novel and i remembered that if it was snowing heavily and you can't find shelter, that you can dig into the snow at an angle to make something like a snow ""cave"" and that the temperatures won't be as high and more importantly the wind won't reach you.

How to Navigate With Cut Tree Bark &amp; Sunlight &amp; Shadow of Stick,"Dear fellow prepared folk,

I saw this movie called The Way Back (2010) by Peter Weir.

It was harrowing to watch to say the least to see these men try to make their way South.

I noticed that the protagonist tried to tell the direction without a compass by looking at the grass . . I am curious how do you tell direction by looking at grass ?

In case people want to observe this survivalist work in action the link to the movie is :

i saw this movie called the way back (2010) by peter weir.

it was harrowing to watch to say the least to see these men try to make their way south.

i noticed that the protagonist tried to tell the direction without a compass by looking at the grass . . i am curious how do you tell direction by looking at grass ?

in case people want to observe this survivalist work in action the link to the movie is :

"My Friend Wants To Recreate Chris McCandless Journey From ""Into The Wild"", And he Won't Listen To me.","I have a friend and I share his dream of wanting to be completely self sufficient, and be a hermit that lives in nature.

I believe doing so will require early retirement, and having enough money to live the rest of your life comfortably.

He however wants to do exactly what Chris McCandless did, sell everything he owns, and walk into the wilds of Alaska and survive.

I think this is a terrible idea, and will most likely lead to his death just like it did Chris McCandless.

He argues just because some idiot in a movie died doesn't mean he will.

He has no wilderness survival training, and plans on taking the bare minimum of supplies.

I've tried to explain to him that you need to boil water you get from streams due to protozoa, amoebas, parasites, fungi, viruses and bacteria etc. He says if the water is cold it's fine.

I've tried to explain game meat is full of parasites and must be cooked well. Not only this but there is an epidemic of prion diseases in wildlife recently that cannot be killed via cooking the meat, not to mention rabies virus, etc.

He is going to have to worry about Lyme disease from ticks, mosquito borne diseases, bear, wolf, and coyote attacks, and all kinds of stuff.

Having no cellphone to call for help, no stockpiles of food or medicine, no way to reach civilization, and no healthcare if he did make it back.

You also have to contend with the department of natural resources, game wardens, fish and wildlife, forest service officers. They will not just let you squat on public land and if you are found you'll be arrested.

What happens when winter comes and you don't have enough food stored up?

"Death Valley Germans, how they could have survived:","After doing my own research on death valley I wanted to find some solutions to how fatal trips could have gone better

Even in the summer months, the rate of car flow down any road new a landmark, like Geologists cabin, would likely be above 1 car every two days.

The geologists cabin had ample supplies of water and food, and was close to a spring (several) that would supply people for years. If they rationed out their supplies, they could have survived for up to a week.

Given that Egbert had enough strength to walk several miles, and then with his family over 9 miles in the heat while wasting time, I say ditch the beer, and just walk all the way back to geologists cabin, which they should have on map.

Then go to the springs whenever water is scarce, food should be provided at the cabin but is not really as important. 

Then have a person stand near a road way motioning for passing cars. If we can do this in shifts, and repeat for days, eventually a car will pass by. Even if one car ignores us, given a week eventually rangers will likely be called to the cabin which is a marked location.  Or at least until it is restocked. 

In addition starting a fire or writing SOS or both will increase the likelyhood that someone will see something is wrong.

An odd bear/mountain lion question.,"So there a lot of posts here about animal proofing already, but I've not seen one about my specific question. 

There are of course the usual tips. Store food in bear boxes away from camp. Hang it in trees. Burry it even. But bears are clever bastards and it's never a guarantee. Not to mention a hungry bear/mt lion might see me in my hammock-tent as a tasty burrito. So I've been thinking about alternatives to animal proofing a campsite. Compact solutions I can carry in my car or kayak. 

Has anyone had personal success with a noise maker trip wire? I know they make the emergency 12 gauge trip wire to really scare things off but that's one use only. There are also many electrical trip wires but because I'll often be on the water I'd like to avoid electronics. I'm talking just a sturdy wire maybe braided fishing wire with noise makers. Metal clackers, cans, what have you. I figure both animals scare easily when it comes to unknown sounds. So it could be a good alternative if it were loud enough plus it would alert me to danger at the same time.

has anyone had personal success with a noise maker trip wire? i know they make the emergency 12 gauge trip wire to really scare things off but that's one use only. there are also many electrical trip wires but because i'll often be on the water i'd like to avoid electronics. i'm talking just a sturdy wire maybe braided fishing wire with noise makers. metal clackers, cans, what have you. i figure both animals scare easily when it comes to unknown sounds. so it could be a good alternative if it were loud enough plus it would alert me to danger at the same time. 

if you have used them, any suggestions for materials that are easily carried? if it can fit on/in my pack that would be even better."
"Store water that will not freeze? In car, in tent, etc?","How one might store water in a place that is for few days or weeks left empty and not heated?

1) in my car or bike left for few days or even weeks

2) some primitive shelter like tent or some dugout out in the wild


If I just get bottled water, then in heavy winter it will freeze, I will come back to a bottle of ice. With bad luck I guess it might break open and if it is freezing and unfreezing day/night it can even spill over car.

Any practical ideas? Something else than water, perhaps like salted water (and filter it before drinking - how?).

How long can people actually survive without food?,"We've all heard the pop science fact that people can survive three days without water and three weeks without food. Clearly this cannot be a universal rule, since there are many people both fat and thin who have gone more than three weeks without food.   


Some examples:

1. Ghandi was said to have fasted exactly three weeks in protest of british colonial rule
2. David Blaine allegedly fasted 44 days while confined to a glass box in the Thames river
3. The longest medically documented fast was by Angus Barbieri, an obese man who fasted for 382 days in 1966-1967
4. There are survival shows like History Channel's ""Alone"" where some of the heftier participants have survived for more than 70 days with almost no food. 

Some of these examples are probably fraudulent, but it seems likely that at least one of them is true.

It’s more common than you might think and it’s vital to know what to should you find yourself in that situation as it could be the difference between life and death.

Boulder Outdoor Survival School,"I am proud to be an instructor at BOSS, Boulder Outdoor Survival School. We are the oldest and most respected survival school in the world.

We are a 501(c)(3) educational nonprofit. Our mission statement is:

&gt;*The Boulder Outdoor Survival School is dedicated to the instruction and preservation of traditional living skills and the development of people through experiences within the  natural world.*

We are also known as a hardcore school which offers the most extreme challenge in survivalism.

While our reputation is accurate to some extent, as is our mission statement, our reputation is misleading because it only represents a small part of what we are about. 

What are we about? To me, BOSS is about investing in human beings. To understand what that means, you have to understand what will become of you if you complete a BOSS field course. 

In the field courses you will:

* Learn traditional skills and rely on them for an extended period in an austere setting
* Experience a traditional human context by living as a small, self reliant tribe existing isolated in a rugged landscape
* Negotiate the substantial challenges inherent in extended travel through difficult and hostile 	terrain with simple gear

\-Gandalf",0,1636582733,Grey_Matter_Man,46,1,True,2021-11-10,"boulder outdoor survival school i am proud to be an instructor at boss, boulder outdoor survival school. we are the oldest and most respected survival school in the world.

we are a 501(c)(3) educational nonprofit. our mission statement is:

&gt;*the boulder outdoor survival school is dedicated to the instruction and preservation of traditional living skills and the development of people through experiences within the  natural world.*

we are also known as a hardcore school which offers the most extreme challenge in survivalism.

while our reputation is accurate to some extent, as is our mission statement, our reputation is misleading because it only represents a small part of what we are about. 

what are we about? to me, boss is about investing in human beings. to understand what that means, you have to understand what will become of you if you complete a boss field course. 

in the field courses you will:

* learn traditional skills and rely on them for an extended period in an austere setting
* experience a traditional human context by living as a small, self reliant tribe existing isolated in a rugged landscape
* negotiate the substantial challenges inherent in extended travel through difficult and hostile 	terrain with simple gear
* gain a survival skill set which is both comprehensive and deep by learning skills in context from master instructors and then applying them to provide for your needs
* become hardened, and more resilient
* learn to comfortably operate in the fringes of human experience
* learn things that are often more practical than what is taught in traditional school

Non-wilderness travel survival in treacherous conditions.,"Acknowledging this possible violates rule 2 but figure I’d leave it to mods to weigh in.

As we head into what is being forecasted to be a colder than normal winter I was speaking to an old army vet who did time in Korea and he shared a tip I’d never consider doing.

On a cross country trip during the last polar vortex we had in the Northern Hemisphere, his car wouldn’t warm while driving in the -15 degree weather.

Being in the plains far from everything he took a cardboard box, tore a side off, and placed it in between the radiator and the grill (concept being it’d stop the cold air washing over the engine area). Car went from frigid to comfortable and he could continue the journey.

"next year i (15m) will be living in the Canadian wilderness for as long as i want, and maybe even for the rest of my life","throughout my entire short (but eventful) life I have gone through so much struggle. my family has always been very poor and struggled with mental illnesses. I remember as a kid my parents would fight all the time and the only place I ever found peace was in the woods. I remember as a kid my father would bring me to the woods and teach me how to forage, make shelters and track animals. when I was nine my father was sent to a mental hospital for a summer, and during that summer I spent every day in the woods foraging for food and trapping and hunting small game because there wasnt food at home.

when I was 11 I was taken from my family and put into foster care where i was subject to constant emotional and physical abuse, where they would make me work the fields from 6AM to 7PM and my hands were raw and bloody. the only escape i had from that were the woods behind my foster parents house, where I would go and walk and make camp and read. i am out of that hell now luckily.

so far in my life the only place I am happy is in the woods, where I can be me and be happy. I have always enjoyed novels such as hatchet and my side of the mountain, where boys are in the wilderness and find themselves, and movies such as into the wild. I wish to do the same thing for as long as I like.

I may winter there, and miss school. I believe I will fail this grade for my grades are already far behind. I hate school so much. every minute I am in school I think about how I would rather be by a campfire in the woods. why is it we are forced into a education? I know people who got a third grade education in the 1960s and everyone was satisfied by that.

 I would rather not live than become a wage slave to some major corporation and make barely enough to feed myself, when I can live in the woods and not need money, using nature as my provider as was intended by whatever you believe. why is it the Canadian government thinks it has the right to say weather or not I can harvest a deer, moose or fish from this land I was born on, when my family has done so since they landed on these shores in 1760? why should anyone feel they have the right to tell me if i can live in the woods, and bother none, and take just what I need to survive from nature? 

i have the supplies and i have the knowledge. i have traps and snares, axes and saws, food and water filters, a shotgun (for legal purposes this part is fiction and should only be taken as so), a crossbow, fire staring supplies, the knowledge in my head and the clothes on my back. i plan to settle in a near river, away from civilization. if i come through with a mental breakthrough and decide to head back than i shall, but i do not think that will be the case. i will hunt and forage for food and build a cabin. i would rather work  every damn day to survive in the wilderness than go to school or a 9 to 5!.

i may winter there, and miss school. i believe i will fail this grade for my grades are already far behind. i hate school so much. every minute i am in school i think about how i would rather be by a campfire in the woods. why is it we are forced into a education? i know people who got a third grade education in the 1960s and everyone was satisfied by that.

 i would rather not live than become a wage slave to some major corporation and make barely enough to feed myself, when i can live in the woods and not need money, using nature as my provider as was intended by whatever you believe. why is it the canadian government thinks it has the right to say weather or not i can harvest a deer, moose or fish from this land i was born on, when my family has done so since they landed on these shores in 1760? why should anyone feel they have the right to tell me if i can live in the woods, and bother none, and take just what i need to survive from nature? 

i have the supplies and i have the knowledge. i have traps and snares, axes and saws, food and water filters, a shotgun (for legal purposes this part is fiction and should only be taken as so), a crossbow, fire staring supplies, the knowledge in my head and the clothes on my back. i plan to settle in a near river, away from civilization. if i come through with a mental breakthrough and decide to head back than i shall, but i do not think that will be the case. i will hunt and forage for food and build a cabin. i would rather work  every damn day to survive in the wilderness than go to school or a 9 to 5!. 

 screw the american dream of being a slave to some company who will work you to death. i will the live the canadian dream, living in the wild."

Help finding a book I saw years ago,"Hi!

Some years ago, I saw on the internet a very interesting book about housing architecture/design, that explained how houses/shelters should be built under different circumstances (I'm not totally sure whether the book was related to survivalism or not). I remember it didn't discuss complex design, the housing examples were somewhat primitive.

I remember one part that explained the design for a desert house and explained in depth the orientation for the windows (taking into consideration sandstorms) and other particularities of the construction. Other than that, I remember it talked about constructing in other biomes too.

The book had a lot of drawings like the one below I took from a Permaculture book (it isn't the book I mentioned), which may be related to the book I'm searching for.

Thank you!

Need help for a problem,"Hi guys. 

I will immediately get to the point: I carry an offsprey 40 for my backpacking/trekking/bushcrafty activities.
Something I noticed last month is that in summer I prefer going lighter, but at the same time right now (rainy period) I’d like to pack some extra stuff without overweighting the backpack. So the solution I thought about was a buttpack or some sort of Fanny pack to carry the extra stuff and in summer use only that instead of the backpack if I’m not sleeping outside.

Do you have any experience with it? Can you tell me where/what should I look for and what could solve this pickle? Everything I find online from military surplus stores here in Italy looks “Chinese-y”, low quality that will break. I’d rather invest a bit more and get some good quality stuff that lasts, as I did with the backpack and it’s going strong for 6 years now.

Let's talk reality,"So I've seen thousands of posts along the lines of ""survival bag-help needed"", which are great, but not necessarily what I consider the most likely scenario to happen. Usually when it comes to a real life or death situation you don't have your five moras, medpack and AR 15  with you. 


So I want to dedicate this post to discussing real survival. 


According to Murphy's law, whenever you have your bag with you nothing's gonna happen, and when you take your evening stroll, that's where disaster will strike. That's where you will have to MacGyver, if you remember the post from a few weeks ago. 


So let's talk most likely situations, in your opinion, and how to get out of them with your*real* EDC carry. I'll start:


Whenever it comes to survival, I think of what can happen to you if no one's around and no one's coming to save you. (Just like real life :)) So let's talk medical emergency. You broke your leg. You're bleeding bad. You lost a limb. You have no medpack. Possibly not even a belt.


This is where string and sticks come in. Either you find some nearby, or your have to fashion it yourself, that's probably gonna be your lifesaver, or, if you get hung up too long on it, what kills you.

What are your most intense experiences with hypothermia? Mine was four nights without shelter at around 35°F (2C),"I've experienced hypothermia in different ways so i'm interested to hear of other anecdotes beyond normal shivering from being out in the elements for a while. 

In my case, the shivering i experienced during those four days, normally only during the night, was completely different from the regular sensation one experiences from being in cold water or without proper clothing. 

It was a hiking accident and i didn't have proper clothing either, basically one layer. What surprised me is how warm my body was throughout the night, even my extremities. I lost an incredible amount of weight so i'm assuming by body just kicked it into high gear.

Makes me wonder about what's the boundary between our body's capacity to keep us warm and succumbing to hypothermia. 

Bc I genuinely believed i was way over my head and i was going to die. It was literally like living inside a fridge for four days. There were patches of snow around me and i didn't think i have a chance in hell, so mentally i wasn't helping either. 

This happened when i was a teenager and from being careless and dumb, so if you feel inclined to comment that, do so but i already know that.

Why does the cordage on my bow drills keep breaking?,"I've been trying to make fires with completely foraged materials. I can make a bow drill with paracord and I'll have a fire in no time.

Change my view: a gun is not a useful survival tool,"I’m of the opinion that a gun (rifle/handgun/ shotgun) is not a useful tool in a survival situation. I’d like to start a conversation about this to learn more and test my belief.


Reasons I can think of to carry a gun:

-	Hunting
-	self defense- animals
-	self defense -humans 
-	signaling - loud noises


Reflections on each point

1.	Hunting - I understand at varying levels different firearms have the capacity to take down Small to large game. — however if you are anticipating a scenario where you will be stuck in the wild enough to have a firearm ready you should have also taken other steps to not be in a Survival situation which would require you to need more than a few days calories.
2.	animal defense - I understand a well trained marksman could take down an animal with luck and skill — from what I can research most people don’t have as much skill as they need and if they don’t kill the animal immediately the chance of more violent attack is likely. Not to mention possibly shooting someone else in an attack.
3.	human defense- I know the least about this? Is this a realistic situation that being smart and making good choices couldn’t avoid?
4.	signaling - a gun costs 500+ and you have limited ammo - carry a whistle, mirror, or air horn instead. Plus anything that makes noise is an effective way to keep an animal away.


TLDR: a gun has very limited usefulness and you are better served being prepared and taking a few basic small items with you ex: whistle

Stop The Bleed training,"I have to brag about my 9 year-old son for a minute: I'm part of a disaster readiness group and, last night, we hosted a Stop-The-Bleed training. I was discussing it with my wife  and my 9 year-old son asked if he could take the class too. We said he could as long as he paid attention and didn't disrupt the other students.

That boy absolutely loved it! He learned how to differentiate between superficial and arterial bleeding. He learned how to apply a tourniquet to extremities. He learned how to apply a chest seal for a punctured lung and how to improvise a chest seal or a tourniquet. He learned how to pack a wound when direct pressure isn't stopping the blood flow. He learned how to apply pressure to a neck wound without strangling the person. He even learned the emergency use of coagulants!

Thoughts on learning survival from books YouTube etc.,"We get a lot of posts asking about learning survival from online courses etc. I also get a lot of PMs about it and usually end up typing out some comprehensive (grandiloquent) version of the following. Please let me know your thoughts.

I would caution against learning online or through books (there used to be mail order courses too) as either your primary way or if you are new. I've seen way too many people with really bad habits from doing it this way. The most common example is that no one should take more than a day or two to get a bow drill fire; this sub is littered with people who ask for bow drill tips after failing for weeks and months and the tip is always the same: get in person instruction.

There are several reasons for this. First, if you are new you don't have a bullshit detector for survival (which is okay you're new) so you'll inevitably pursue a lot of content that is useless as well as some that is actively harmful &gt; *cough bear grylls cough* &lt;. Second, even a very good book or dvd can't possibly address all the little nuances that apply to your individual learning. They will include a bunch of things that are irrelevant and omit a bunch of things that are relevant. There are other reasons as well but those are the main two.

That's not to say media resources aren't useful. Quite the contrary, they have benefits that in person courses do not. For example, I couldn't possibly study under all the great outdoorsmen out there for obvious logistical reasons. But through the magic of interwebbing I can be exposed and learn something from many many great teachers. Another one is that getting different points of view while learning is much easier, during an in person class it's rare to get instructors with wildly differing yet useful views. But with a source like YouTube I can easily search for multiple videos from different people with different views.

All the above applies more or less equally to any media whether books, podcasts, videos etc. But there is one important difference between online sources --especially places like Reddit- and things like books, abd that is that it is interactive. For that reason I think most the new people who posts about learning online really don't get online learning. That's the irony, they mostly talk about how they can't get in person training. Instead they should be posting pics and videos and asking for advice. 

But the real problem is that beginners don't know the right questions to ask, and part of our responsibility as teachers is to recognize that and apprehend what the student should be asking instead. But the users of most websites consistently fail to do that when dealing with beginners asking for advice. They usually comment with some version of the pros and cons I list above. While those pros and cons are important from a theoretical perspective, what's really important for a beginner is practical application. So instead of critiques of online courses our response should be ""why don't you upload a video if yourself doing X task and we can give you some advice"".  Even if we do recommend other online sources, I rarely see the other users ask relevant questions before giving advice. For example most beginners focus just on the skill and ignore context, so they ask for good videos on bow drill or whatever. We should ask them about where in the world they are, previous experience etc. We might even use those answers to advise against bow drill and suggest a fire plow or fire saw, for example if the person is in a tropical area those two are usually preferred over bow or hand drill. For more general questions such as ""how do I go about learning survival"" I usually start by asking what their goals are. A person who intends to spend most their time hiking and wants some skills in case of emergency will benefit from different resources than a person who wants to recreate the skills of a particular time period or culture. In many cases it doesn't even take a suggestion and we can give them good advise just through questioning them.

In general I think we are missing an opportunity to engage new people. If they are asking about books or videos they obviously have some time to devote to it and we should do better at getting them to spend that time actively engaged. Besides this sub there are a lot of other relevant subs, and a lot of other interactive sites such as BCUSA's bush class. YouTube personalities will sometimes challenge viewers to upload videos of them doing things. And so on.

"In the event of disaster could one survive on a diet of solely rabbit meat, brown rice, olive oil and pine needle tea?","I’m thinking about what I’d eat if for whatever reason I was no longer able to buy food from a shop. From reading things around the internet I’ve gathered that game meat is a good source of protein, brown rice is easily storable and a source of carbs (energy) and fibre and because of rabbit’s lean nature, olive oil is good for fats and it’s also easy to stockpile.

Should I teach myself how to suture a wound? + looking for advice on my current set up,"Im setting up a kit for emergency situations and hitting the road for a possibly very long road trip. Being entirely honest, I am a tad bit prone to trouble so im preparing for as much as I can think of and afford to prepare for. 


Currently I have a basic emergency kit. Basic first aid, matches, treatments for ways I commonly get sick, pain medication, and a few other things like some pads good for burn pain relief. Im considering adding a suture kit to this or something that can hold closed a larger wound. Im not sure which rout I should take on this measure. 



Currently this is what I have in my kit, its set up with common problems in mind and less survival issues.


Netti pot
Anti nausea 
Uti relief
Yeast infection relief
Eye drops
Matches
Burn pain relief
Bandages
Gloves
Pain relief (multiple types)
Antacids
Back up medication
And emergency medication for a medical contition I have
Also hydrogen peroxide, alchohol, and some creams



I think the most likely situation I might come across is getting stranded either due to a rock slide, a wreck, or cold weather. The areas I might go have a likelyhood of not having service, I am considering a sat phone but the prices Ive seen so far are way too high for me. If anyone knows of a small 911 device that connects almost anywhere via sat or even just any method available that would be ideal. Other then that im considering food rations, portable solar panels, a few tools for survival if I had to walk out to civilization, and a more intensive kit. Ive done a good amount of research and am confident, tho it wouldnt be pretty, I could likely make it in the woods shelter and water wise, sadly though not food wise as I am not an experienced forager and I cannot hunt. I am on the other hand aware of the way to check if plants are dangerous to est is probably the worst way possible (hours of slow tested exposure risking harm at every step)

what food lasts for extremely long periods of time? are there any recommendations for survival food that would be stored in high temps (the trunk of a car for instance)? is there any relative philosophy to decision-making about this subject? i am considering maybe focusing on survival gear that would allow for the capture/creation of food rather than just trying to store food that will go bad every 10 years. the more general knowledge provided in relation to this subject the better. i appreciate anything you might have to offer - especially if it is a different way of thinking about the question."

Black bear and wood ash.,"Was watching S7 of Alone, and there was an episode where a blackbear was getting close to one of the contestants camps, and likely turned away when it smelled the campfire smoke  As the wind changed. And the option to stock the bear and hunt it was on the table. 

 Later on i was looking up snare designs I came across an unrelated link about using wood ash in your plants in your garden and it is also a deterrent for bugs and some other animal etc. 

 My question really started as: would you  be able to surround a camp with burnt log or wood ash and essentially deter or direct the bear to meander elsewhere?

I figure since animals generally do not enjoy the smell of burning smoke or similar, and a black bear's sense of smell is so strong and is its main way to see 'so to speak', then it would make a deterrent even if it is an  weak one.

‘This one simple trick’ to avoid getting lost.,"https://s1.wklcdn.com/image_147/4427650/33594409/21652819Master.jpg

‘In May 2019, yoga teacher and physical therapist Amanda Eller was lost for 17 days in the dense inland forests of Maui after a three-mile hike turned into a harrowing ordeal. She set out on foot without a cell phone, food, or water, as she only planned to be out for a short jaunt. After venturing off the trail, she wasn’t able to find her way back. She suffered from severe sunburn, leg injuries, and the loss of her shoes but survived by eating berries, drinking stream water, and sleeping among leaves. After more than two weeks, a rescue helicopter spotted her atop a waterfall.’

https://www.outsideonline.com/2397412/missing-maui-hikers-search-noah-mino-amanda-eller

This is a classic example of how an ordinary person out for a hike or run, takes a short break not far off trail, gets turned around and disappears. She survived with a broken leg and no shoes. Her original trail run was only supposed to be 3 miles. 

When it comes to navigation everyone talks about maps, compasses and gps, but gps can fail, dense forest can make it impossible to see landmarks for map work and she, like many other people, really didn’t think she’d need any of that, after all she was planning a short run on a marked trail, not an expedition.

Except that she stepped off the trail. 

And she didn’t do the one simple thing to avoid getting lost that needs no special equipment. Only awareness. She didn’t mark her trail. 

She could have tied a bright cloth to a tree, or made stick arrows to point her back to the trail. But she didn’t, because she wasn’t thinking about the risk. Without marking her way she should never have left the trail at all, but she was complacent about her ability to find her way back. An alarm should have gone off in her head as she thought “I’ll just find a quiet place to meditate.” But it didn’t. 

This complacency and lack of awareness is what causes so many people to get lost in forests where no clear landmarks may be visible. Geraldine Largay did something very similar on the AT but sadly wasn’t found in time. 

Trail marking, with either bright tape or string or rocks and sticks is the simplest way to create a ‘route home’ whenever we explore a side trail or go off trail, moving in straight lines from one visible marker to the next. 

I’m not suggesting we litter the forest with discarded flagging tape, it should always be removed as we return along our path but when we’re exploring off trail or need to be sure that we can return to our starting point it’s a valuable technique and practising it helps create the awareness of risk which hopefully will prevent complacency. It’s always better to not get lost than deal with being lost.

Knife care,"     Hi guys, first time posting here so my friend convinced me to go hiking with her about a month ago and since then I’ve been reading the book Bush craft 101 by Dave Canterbury. I figured it would give me the run down of the basic things I should know and advanced things I’ll read about later on. 
     I just read about knife care and according to what I read only three steps matter. Fine sharpening, Honing, and Stropping. I plan on getting a Japanese Whetstone 1000/6000. So I’m assuming the 6000 side is for fine sharpening and the 1000 is for quick sharpening? Not sure what the difference is since don’t they take the same amount of time/strokes? I know I should soak the whetstone with water first and that if I were to use oil I can’t use water again. 
     My second question is that how exactly does the honing process work? The book was pretty vague on that. Also about diamond rods if they’re for sharpening wouldn’t it be redundant to have one if I plan on using a whet stone? 
     About honing I forgot to mention ceramic rods but I also read that it says honing with a ceramic rod is just like honing with a whet stone. So if someone can clarify how I would hone with a whet stone, thanks! Lastly I have a picture how the strop process would work, but if someone can explain also would any leather belt suffice?

Does my friend have rabies? [serious + worried],"I was hanging out with my friends last night and we were eating our dinners on the deck around 10 pm. The deck is built on an elevated stone platform. Suddenly, I hear my friend yell because a raccoon had crawled up the side of the stone platform. Turns out, the raccoon had grabbed my friend's foot (he was only wearing those thick puma Costco socks which are around 3 mm thick. You can give em a search on google images with those exact words ""thick puma costco socks""). The raccoon only retracted its claws once my friend felt the claw grabbing his foot. 

Around 2 hours later, he returned back home and took a shower. None of us thought anything of it at the moment so we didn't immediately clean his foot or anything. I wasn't that concerned until I started reading more about rabies. I found that claws could carry rabies and none of us are sure whether or not it came in contact with his skin/broke through it. When we look at the foot, there aren't any marks but I'm worried that the claws might have left a prickle too small for us to notice now and that rabies might have entered his system. 

I've been reading so many different forums about rabid animals and the raccoon seems to have some of the symptoms (some of them continued to chill near the stone platform). They weren't easily spooked when we started clapping our hands or flashing our lights at them. That behavior seemed like it fit the description of one of the symptoms I found which was ""an animal seemingly oblivious to noise or nearby movement"". 

I don't want to make a big deal out of it just yet considering that it was the animal's claws and that he was wearing socks but part of me is still worried that something might have happened.

Getting Started with building a Survival Kit,"It's the time of year when a lot of people get more excited to trek outdoors again. Myself included. And with that a lot of people think it's a good idea to build a survival kit.

I've seen a lot of fantastic kits on this subreddit, and I've seen a lot of terrible ones as well.

I'm not an expert. There are people on this subreddit that are far more knowledgeable than I am. I'm just here to put people new to survival on the right path. 

I believe that anyone new to survival will build a far better survival kit after reading and considering this post. Even if we don't agree on my philosophy. If you do so you'll built a way more viable survival kit than a lot of kits that newcomers post here. 

# Wilderness Survival vs Urban Survival

This subreddit is about Wilderness survival so the focus on this post us wilderness survival. Urban survival kits have different priorities and items. (For example currency/money, FM/AM radio, bolt cutters, fire hydrant key, etc.)

That said, there's a ton of overlap between the two.

# This post is just about the Kit, with is a terrible way to think about survival

This post only talks about building a good survival kit. If you do not practice survival skills and learn how to actually use the items in the kit, the kit is going to be useless. 

And I didn't say ""learn"" survival skills. I said practice. Watching YouTube videos is only going to get you so far. So go out camping and while you so do so practice skills. You become a better outdoorsman/woman along the way and be better prepared for a survival situation. 

# Survival vs Bushcraft/Camping

The two are often confused a bit. (especially on this subreddit). I leave what this subreddit is all about up for debate, but for the point of this post I'm going to clearly distinguish between survival and good old bushcraft.

If you want to talk about and discuss camping in comfort with minimal gear, r/bushcraft is a great place t o do so. 

Training survival skills can be fun. True survival never is fun. If you go out in the woods to camp out with minimal gear, you're probably just exercising bushcraft, even if you don't build a shelter out of wood. 

A survival kit isn't a camping kit. A camping kit's focus is there to make you comfortable and enjoy yourself in the outdoors. A Survival kit's focus is there to keep you alive and to get you home.

Of course, items in both kits overlap. A single walled metal canteen is fantastic for both survival as regular wilderness camping for example. In fact a fully loaded camping backpack with some additional emergency items is probably the best survival kit there is.

However, many survival kits are build to have with you when you don't plan to stay outdoors for long. These kits often don't have the luxuries of a camping kit because it's essential that these kits stay light and portable

Witch leads me to the first point...

# How big is your kit going to be and what is going to look like?

This is a big important question. What kind of kit are you building and when will you carry it with you?

* **Lanyard survival kit** consisting of a handful of items on a piece of rope like a whistle, small knife, ferro rod etc.
* **Altoids tin survival kit** have a bit more items like maybe a button compass, needle and thread, some band-aids, mini lighter etc.
* **Survival Pouch** is about the size of something you might want to carry on your belt
* **Canteen survival kit** is where you start of with a metal canteen and stuff all your survival items in there. Reason why these kits are a thing is because a metal canteen is a very important survival item to have, one of the biggest one in size, and hollow to keep all your other things in. 
* **Dedicated Backpack is a backpack fully designed to keep you alive and get you home.**
* **Survival Items in your camping kit/clothing.** This is one that Survivarman's Les Stroud put's emphasis on. If you're going to build a kit that you have on you when outdoors, it's best to not put all your survival items in one location or one person even. Have that fixed blade knife on your belt but the multitool in your backpack. Keep the ferro rod in your fire kit but a bic lighter in your pocket. etc. 
* **Survival Items in your EDC bag.** I do this all the time. I have a select number of survival items in my EDC bag at all times. I don't go overboard but I know that if I do get stranded I have the essentials to at least make it trough a couple of days. It's always good practice to have the basics with you wherever you go. Especially when it comes to items that come in handy outside of a survival situation like first aid, repair items and some tools. 
* **Car/Vehicle kit.** Often the largest kits. Weight is less of a factor so you can make it as big and capable as you're willing to lose on cargo space. 

THE SMALLER THE KIT, THE HARDER IT'S TO USE AND STAY ALIVE WITH

I think altoids kits are neat, but also extremely hard to use. They often don't have good answers to the most common survival problems you're likely to face. If you aim to build a good starting survival kit you need to go Pouch or bigger in my opinion. 

That said, even a few essentials around a keychain in your pocket are better to have than nothing at all. If you carry your tiny kit with you all the time, it's still a viable kit even if it doesn't include a fixed blade knife for example.  

# Every kit has it's weight and size limit

The best Survival Kit is the kit that you have with you when disaster strikes. The worst one is the one you left at camp because it was too cumbersome to bring with you. 

**EVERYTHING YOU PUT INTO YOUR SURVIVAL KIT IS AT THE EXPENSE OF SOMETHING ELSE**

This is one of the most important rules I see people constantly forget when they build their kit. You can't bring everything. You just can't. 

It's the reason why not kit of mine has handwarmers, air mattress, a shovel, or (for my personal choice) an axe even.

I want to make a note here that this is different from the TV Show Alone where participants know ahead of time that they will have to survive with a select number of items. In that scenario it makes complete sense to bring an axe. 

There are tons of potentially useful things to put in your kit, but survival kits get way too big/heavy way too fast if you put in everything that's ""useful"" in there. The biggest danger of having a kit that big that it's impractical to carry so you don't bring it with you when disaster strikes. 

A three pound axe can be extremely useful in a survival situation but think about everything else you could bring for 3 pounds in weight? Think about how easier your kit would be to carry if it didn't included that extra 3 pounds on how more likely you'll be to have it on you in small excursions. 

Same goes for a riffle. If your rifle is part of your base camping kit and it happens to be on you in a survival situation, than it might come in handy. But if your kit includes an AR-15, but not a water filter system and a decent tarp, it's straight up a bad kit that prioritizes weight on all the wrong things. 

Always keep in mind that it's next to impossible to predict what items you'll need so we can only look at trends, risks and expectations to make the right assessment of what tools to include in your kit. 

Witch brings me to the next big point....

# Think about priorities/systems

Often bad survivalists put there priorities in the wrong order or ignore certain systems entirely

A big one  I often see on the subreddit is kits with big emphasis on fire making tools ,cutting tools, self protection, but ignoring first aid, water purification/collection, and shelter. Remember that great survival kits are often kinda dull. 

Here are the most important systems you need to have your bases covered in in no particular order:

&amp;#x200B;

**Immediate first aid for life threatening conditions**

Often in a survival situation, there's been an accident first, or you got in an accident while staying alive after the disaster. What items in your kit are there to stop the bleeding, threat deep cuts, disinfect wounds, etc. And more importantly, do you know how to actually do these  things? 

Typical items: Bandages, band aids, steri strips, antibiotics, tourniquet, gauze, ibuprofen, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Water purification/collection**

How will you collect and purify water? How will you collect water from a lake/river without collecting dirt, how will you sterilize water, will you collect rainwater, collect water trough condensation, snow etc.?

Typical items: metal canteen to boil water in, metal pot, water filter, purification tabs, cloth/shemagh to filter out dirt first, plastic bags/platypus, tinfoil o boil water with in an emergency for the smallest kits, plastic tarp, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shelter, and protection against the elements**

How will you protect yourself against hypothermia or sunburn. What items/techniques you will use to ensure you have shelter. And what clothing will you have on you when disaster strikes? Is that clothing adequate enough to protect you or allow you to walk to safety in bad terrain? 

Typical items: Tarp, poncho, space blanket, paracord/cordage, shemagh, gloves, extra socks, walking shoes in your get home bag, folding saw, knife to cut branches with

&amp;#x200B;

**Fire**

How will you start your fire and what will you use as fuel? What if you need to start a fire in terrible wet/windy conditions? 

Typical items: Ferro rid, magnifying lens, BIC lighter, fuel tabs/fire starters, waterproof matches, folding saw, ducktape to use as firestarter

&amp;#x200B;

**Signaling**

How will you signal for help? How do you single people on the ground or aerial search units? 

Typical items: a good whistle (must for any kit IMO) , orange colored space blanket/poncho, mirror, flare, SPOT device/satellite phone, power bank for your phone/solar panel, flashlight, airhorn

&amp;#x200B;

**Communication**

How will you leave information in the disaster site, or hear what authorities are reporting to you.

Typical items: Water proof paper, marker/pencil/pen, powerbank/solar panel

&amp;#x200B;

**Navigating**

If you decide to leave the disaster site, how will you navigate and know where you're going How will you navigate in the dark

Typical items: compass, GPS device , pace count beads, paper map of the area, powerbank/solar panel for a phone, headlamp/flashlight for night time treks

&amp;#x200B;

**Item Repair/maintenance**

How will you maintain and repair your gear during a survival situation

Typical items: ducktape, needle and thread, sharpening stone

After you have all these bases covered at least to some extend, I think it's time to look into these. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Food Gathering**

How will you gather food for sustained survival? 

Typical items: Fishing kit, snare wire, fishing net, plant identification guide, hunting rifle, larger bag/pouch to carry what you gathered

A word on hunting though: keep in mind that there are passive and active food gathering methods. Hunting is very much an active food gathering method that often takes the most skill, and often makes it necessary to roam about the disaster site for long stretches of time. This are often luxuries you simply don't have when in a survival situation. Just be aware.

Also consider people can go without food for a considerable amount of time. It's great to have food gathering items/methods in your kit but it shouldn't be a main priority in terms of weight. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Protection**

How will you portect yourself from wildlife or people in a survival situation.

Typical items: rifle, hand gun, bear spray, air horn, etc.

Personally I think this last one is often overrated especially because of the first principle that every kit has it's limits especially because most fulfill this need by bringing a rifle in their kit. 

Could a rifle come in handy for self protection in a survival situation. Possibly. I'm not debating that. 

I'm debating that if you look at the list above, you have better things to bring with you than a large firearm to increase your chances of survival. Think about how frequently you really have had to protect yourself when out in the wild. Now think how likely it would be need to fulfill the other priorities a any wilderness. Millions of people have enjoyed the Scandinavian and Canadian wilderness without a firearm and yet continue to go there year after year by simply using other tactics and equipment. 

That said, if you go to bear country, bring your bear spray. No matter what other survival kit strategy you might have. It's just common sense. 

If you want to bring a rifle in the woods for whatever reason, please do so as long as it's legal. I have zero problems with people bringing rifles when it comes to camping. But think long and hard if you specifically put a rifle in your survival kit as part of your survival strategy. 

Also, if your protection strategy against bear is a handgun, you're either an expert marksmen that is able to make perfect shots against a moving target in any high stress life-or-death situation, or you're an idiot. To put it bluntly. 

In a wilderness survival situation protection against other human beings is even less of a factor. How terrible luck would you have to overcome a survival situation only to encounter an individual willing to kill you over the basic equipment you're carrying... 

In short, carry a firearm in the wilds if you want to. If you take it as a survival item make sure you have all your other bases well covered. Consider alternatives that are more compact and lighter. Seriously doubt your ability to kill a bear or large wildlife with a handgun.

&amp;#x200B;

**Knowledge**

Lastly I want to talk about having a survival guide in your kit. Some guru's are great to remember every survival technique but for most of us ""weekend warriors"" that's often not the case. It might be worth having a pocket survival guide in your kit. Especially when it comes to foraging and plant identification guide. 

# The 5/10 C's of bushcraft

Dave Canterbury made this technique as a overview/guide for the items you need in a buschraft scenario.

1. Cutting Tool. A.k.a. fixed blade knife. Preferably carbon steal
2. Combustion device. A.k.a. thing to make wire with like matches, lighter or ferro rod
3. Cover. A.k.a tarp or , space blanket
4. Container. A.k.a metal canteen suitable for boiling water
5. Cordage. A.k.a. paracord or tarred bank line
6. Cotton Bandanas. A.k.a. shemagh/scarf to filter water in or use as cover
7. Cargo Tape. A.k.a. ducktap to repair tiems with or useas kindling
8. Compass
9. Cloth Sail Needle. A.k.a. a thicker needle use for repairs and first aid
10. Candling device. A.k.a. headlamp.

This is a good starting point and a good way to cover the basics. It's good to try to have each of these in your kit in one way or another. 

However these 10 items by themselves don't make the best survival kit. 

I much rather have a water filter with me than I have a needle in my kit for example. There's also very little here in terms of first-aid with is a huge priority when it comes to first aid. 

# Some other points

* Premade kits are rarely any good and never complete. Even Les Stroud's survival kit even doesn't stand on it's own and he knows it and advertises it as such. Don't bother with pre-made survival kits. 
* There's a ton of garbage out there when it comes to survival gear. Even expensive stuff. The more tools in one, the likely more trash it is. That all being said I did have some great items from sites like AliExpress like mini lighters, magnifying lenses, metal pots and emergency whistles. It depends on the item really.
* credit cart size ""survival kits"" are 100% trash
* wire saws are garbage. (Pocket chain saws are viable though)
* These tiny button compasses are garbage. I ordered 12 on Aliepxress on a whim. 10 were widely inaccurate. 1 was leaking when it arrived. 1 out of 12 kinda works but is far from reliable. 
* More expensive isn't always better. A Gränfors Bruk Small Forrest Axe costs around $120. A Fiskars X7 around $30. The later is nearly indestructible, requires next to no maintenance to store forever so is ideal for a survival kit. (The Gränsfors is a fantastic axe though)
* Bigger isn't always better when it comes to knives. A bigger knife is harder to break when you abuse it. that's true. It's also a worse knife for any delicate job. For the love of all that's holly, you should learn how to split wood without an axe/batonning. Even the biggest survival knives will break. I don't care if your BK-9 is huge, try to avoid batonning it or putting it under stress, especially in a survival situation when you risk damaging your main cutting tool. Learn how to properly use the smallest of knives. You can build large shelters and split wood with a small folding knife if you know what you're doing. 
* Have Redundancies. Two is one and one is none. You can be smart about it. For example your kit can contain a folding saw, a larger fixed blade knife, and a multi tool with a knife and saw. If you lose your multi-tool you still have a knife and a saw. If you lose your fixed blade knife you still have a saw and a smaller but still capable knife. If you lose your saw you still have a knife and the ability to saw/cut branches. So if you lose any of these three items you still have all the cutting tools you need. 
* Think multifunctional. A bright orange space blanket is good for shelter and signaling. A Torch is good for night visibility and signaling. Duck tape is good for repairing items as it is a fire starter. A good compass often has a mirror attached that works for signaling and has medical purposes, a larger pot works to boil water as well as a vessel to carry things with while foraging
* If your kit size allows it, (so anything larger than an altoids tin kit, bring 2 lamps/torches. a torch isn't just an excellent signaling device, it's also the thing you need to do pretty much anything at all during the night. I rather lose every single cutting tool in my kit than I would lose my torch. With a torch I'm still able to move around or make a fire when it's dark. Having light or no light during the night often is the difference between survival and certain death. 
* If any survival kit doesn't include a good whistle, it's an instant fail in my book. It's a magical device that allows you to signal during day and night far further than you normally wood, it's basically indestructible, it takes no effort to use, you can use it continuously pretty much forever without worrying about batteries or whatnot, it's tiny, and it weighs next to nothing. There's no reason not to have it with you besides ignorance. 

# Conclusion

That's all I got. Like I said, you can disagree on my philosophy but I think everything I wrote above is important to at least consider. This isn't a complete guide obviously. I could write a full post on every survival item mentioned.

* **survival items in your camping kit/clothing.** this is one that survivarman's les stroud put's emphasis on. if you're going to build a kit that you have on you when outdoors, it's best to not put all your survival items in one location or one person even. have that fixed blade knife on your belt but the multitool in your backpack. keep the ferro rod in your fire kit but a bic lighter in your pocket. etc. 
* **survival items in your edc bag.** i do this all the time. i have a select number of survival items in my edc bag at all times. i don't go overboard but i know that if i do get stranded i have the essentials to at least make it trough a couple of days. it's always good practice to have the basics with you wherever you go. especially when it comes to items that come in handy outside of a survival situation like first aid, repair items and some tools. 
* **car/vehicle kit.** often the largest kits. weight is less of a factor so you can make it as big and capable as you're willing to lose on cargo space. 

the smaller the kit, the harder it's to use and stay alive with

i think altoids kits are neat, but also extremely hard to use. they often don't have good answers to the most common survival problems you're likely to face. if you aim to build a good starting survival kit you need to go pouch or bigger in my opinion. 

that said, even a few essentials around a keychain in your pocket are better to have than nothing at all. if you carry your tiny kit with you all the time, it's still a viable kit even if it doesn't include a fixed blade knife for example.  

# every kit has it's weight and size limit

the best survival kit is the kit that you have with you when disaster strikes. the worst one is the one you left at camp because it was too cumbersome to bring with you. 

**everything you put into your survival kit is at the expense of something else**

this is one of the most important rules i see people constantly forget when they build their kit. you can't bring everything. you just can't. 

it's the reason why not kit of mine has handwarmers, air mattress, a shovel, or (for my personal choice) an axe even.

i want to make a note here that this is different from the tv show alone where participants know ahead of time that they will have to survive with a select number of items. in that scenario it makes complete sense to bring an axe. 

there are tons of potentially useful things to put in your kit, but survival kits get way too big/heavy way too fast if you put in everything that's ""useful"" in there. the biggest danger of having a kit that big that it's impractical to carry so you don't bring it with you when disaster strikes. 

a three pound axe can be extremely useful in a survival situation but think about everything else you could bring for 3 pounds in weight? think about how easier your kit would be to carry if it didn't included that extra 3 pounds on how more likely you'll be to have it on you in small excursions. 

same goes for a riffle. if your rifle is part of your base camping kit and it happens to be on you in a survival situation, than it might come in handy. but if your kit includes an ar-15, but not a water filter system and a decent tarp, it's straight up a bad kit that prioritizes weight on all the wrong things. 

always keep in mind that it's next to impossible to predict what items you'll need so we can only look at trends, risks and expectations to make the right assessment of what tools to include in your kit. 

witch brings me to the next big point....

# think about priorities/systems

often bad survivalists put there priorities in the wrong order or ignore certain systems entirely

a big one  i often see on the subreddit is kits with big emphasis on fire making tools ,cutting tools, self protection, but ignoring first aid, water purification/collection, and shelter. remember that great survival kits are often kinda dull. 

here are the most important systems you need to have your bases covered in in no particular order:

&amp;#x200b;

**immediate first aid for life threatening conditions**

often in a survival situation, there's been an accident first, or you got in an accident while staying alive after the disaster. what items in your kit are there to stop the bleeding, threat deep cuts, disinfect wounds, etc. and more importantly, do you know how to actually do these  things? 

typical items: bandages, band aids, steri strips, antibiotics, tourniquet, gauze, ibuprofen, etc.

&amp;#x200b;

**water purification/collection**

how will you collect and purify water? how will you collect water from a lake/river without collecting dirt, how will you sterilize water, will you collect rainwater, collect water trough condensation, snow etc.?

typical items: metal canteen to boil water in, metal pot, water filter, purification tabs, cloth/shemagh to filter out dirt first, plastic bags/platypus, tinfoil o boil water with in an emergency for the smallest kits, plastic tarp, etc.

&amp;#x200b;

**shelter, and protection against the elements**

how will you protect yourself against hypothermia or sunburn. what items/techniques you will use to ensure you have shelter. and what clothing will you have on you when disaster strikes? is that clothing adequate enough to protect you or allow you to walk to safety in bad terrain? 

typical items: tarp, poncho, space blanket, paracord/cordage, shemagh, gloves, extra socks, walking shoes in your get home bag, folding saw, knife to cut branches with

&amp;#x200b;

**fire**

how will you start your fire and what will you use as fuel? what if you need to start a fire in terrible wet/windy conditions? 

typical items: ferro rid, magnifying lens, bic lighter, fuel tabs/fire starters, waterproof matches, folding saw, ducktape to use as firestarter

&amp;#x200b;

**signaling**

how will you signal for help? how do you single people on the ground or aerial search units? 

typical items: a good whistle (must for any kit imo) , orange colored space blanket/poncho, mirror, flare, spot device/satellite phone, power bank for your phone/solar panel, flashlight, airhorn

&amp;#x200b;

**communication**

how will you leave information in the disaster site, or hear what authorities are reporting to you.

typical items: water proof paper, marker/pencil/pen, powerbank/solar panel

&amp;#x200b;

**navigating**

if you decide to leave the disaster site, how will you navigate and know where you're going how will you navigate in the dark

typical items: compass, gps device , pace count beads, paper map of the area, powerbank/solar panel for a phone, headlamp/flashlight for night time treks

&amp;#x200b;

**item repair/maintenance**

how will you maintain and repair your gear during a survival situation

typical items: ducktape, needle and thread, sharpening stone

after you have all these bases covered at least to some extend, i think it's time to look into these. 

&amp;#x200b;

**food gathering**

how will you gather food for sustained survival? 

typical items: fishing kit, snare wire, fishing net, plant identification guide, hunting rifle, larger bag/pouch to carry what you gathered

a word on hunting though: keep in mind that there are passive and active food gathering methods. hunting is very much an active food gathering method that often takes the most skill, and often makes it necessary to roam about the disaster site for long stretches of time. this are often luxuries you simply don't have when in a survival situation. just be aware.

also consider people can go without food for a considerable amount of time. it's great to have food gathering items/methods in your kit but it shouldn't be a main priority in terms of weight. 

&amp;#x200b;

**personal protection**

how will you portect yourself from wildlife or people in a survival situation.

typical items: rifle, hand gun, bear spray, air horn, etc.

personally i think this last one is often overrated especially because of the first principle that every kit has it's limits especially because most fulfill this need by bringing a rifle in their kit. 

could a rifle come in handy for self protection in a survival situation. possibly. i'm not debating that. 

i'm debating that if you look at the list above, you have better things to bring with you than a large firearm to increase your chances of survival. think about how frequently you really have had to protect yourself when out in the wild. now think how likely it would be need to fulfill the other priorities a any wilderness. millions of people have enjoyed the scandinavian and canadian wilderness without a firearm and yet continue to go there year after year by simply using other tactics and equipment. 

that said, if you go to bear country, bring your bear spray. no matter what other survival kit strategy you might have. it's just common sense. 

if you want to bring a rifle in the woods for whatever reason, please do so as long as it's legal. i have zero problems with people bringing rifles when it comes to camping. but think long and hard if you specifically put a rifle in your survival kit as part of your survival strategy. 

also, if your protection strategy against bear is a handgun, you're either an expert marksmen that is able to make perfect shots against a moving target in any high stress life-or-death situation, or you're an idiot. to put it bluntly. 

in a wilderness survival situation protection against other human beings is even less of a factor. how terrible luck would you have to overcome a survival situation only to encounter an individual willing to kill you over the basic equipment you're carrying... 

in short, carry a firearm in the wilds if you want to. if you take it as a survival item make sure you have all your other bases well covered. consider alternatives that are more compact and lighter. seriously doubt your ability to kill a bear or large wildlife with a handgun.

&amp;#x200b;

**knowledge**

lastly i want to talk about having a survival guide in your kit. some guru's are great to remember every survival technique but for most of us ""weekend warriors"" that's often not the case. it might be worth having a pocket survival guide in your kit. especially when it comes to foraging and plant identification guide. 

# the 5/10 c's of bushcraft

dave canterbury made this technique as a overview/guide for the items you need in a buschraft scenario.

1. cutting tool. a.k.a. fixed blade knife. preferably carbon steal
2. combustion device. a.k.a. thing to make wire with like matches, lighter or ferro rod
3. cover. a.k.a tarp or , space blanket
4. container. a.k.a metal canteen suitable for boiling water
5. cordage. a.k.a. paracord or tarred bank line
6. cotton bandanas. a.k.a. shemagh/scarf to filter water in or use as cover
7. cargo tape. a.k.a. ducktap to repair tiems with or useas kindling
8. compass
9. cloth sail needle. a.k.a. a thicker needle use for repairs and first aid
10. candling device. a.k.a. headlamp.

this is a good starting point and a good way to cover the basics. it's good to try to have each of these in your kit in one way or another. 

however these 10 items by themselves don't make the best survival kit. 

i much rather have a water filter with me than i have a needle in my kit for example. there's also very little here in terms of first-aid with is a huge priority when it comes to first aid. 

# some other points

* premade kits are rarely any good and never complete. even les stroud's survival kit even doesn't stand on it's own and he knows it and advertises it as such. don't bother with pre-made survival kits. 
* there's a ton of garbage out there when it comes to survival gear. even expensive stuff. the more tools in one, the likely more trash it is. that all being said i did have some great items from sites like aliexpress like mini lighters, magnifying lenses, metal pots and emergency whistles. it depends on the item really.
* credit cart size ""survival kits"" are 100% trash
* wire saws are garbage. (pocket chain saws are viable though)
* these tiny button compasses are garbage. i ordered 12 on aliepxress on a whim. 10 were widely inaccurate. 1 was leaking when it arrived. 1 out of 12 kinda works but is far from reliable. 
* more expensive isn't always better. a gränfors bruk small forrest axe costs around $120. a fiskars x7 around $30. the later is nearly indestructible, requires next to no maintenance to store forever so is ideal for a survival kit. (the gränsfors is a fantastic axe though)
* bigger isn't always better when it comes to knives. a bigger knife is harder to break when you abuse it. that's true. it's also a worse knife for any delicate job. for the love of all that's holly, you should learn how to split wood without an axe/batonning. even the biggest survival knives will break. i don't care if your bk-9 is huge, try to avoid batonning it or putting it under stress, especially in a survival situation when you risk damaging your main cutting tool. learn how to properly use the smallest of knives. you can build large shelters and split wood with a small folding knife if you know what you're doing. 
* have redundancies. two is one and one is none. you can be smart about it. for example your kit can contain a folding saw, a larger fixed blade knife, and a multi tool with a knife and saw. if you lose your multi-tool you still have a knife and a saw. if you lose your fixed blade knife you still have a saw and a smaller but still capable knife. if you lose your saw you still have a knife and the ability to saw/cut branches. so if you lose any of these three items you still have all the cutting tools you need. 
* think multifunctional. a bright orange space blanket is good for shelter and signaling. a torch is good for night visibility and signaling. duck tape is good for repairing items as it is a fire starter. a good compass often has a mirror attached that works for signaling and has medical purposes, a larger pot works to boil water as well as a vessel to carry things with while foraging
* if your kit size allows it, (so anything larger than an altoids tin kit, bring 2 lamps/torches. a torch isn't just an excellent signaling device, it's also the thing you need to do pretty much anything at all during the night. i rather lose every single cutting tool in my kit than i would lose my torch. with a torch i'm still able to move around or make a fire when it's dark. having light or no light during the night often is the difference between survival and certain death. 
* if any survival kit doesn't include a good whistle, it's an instant fail in my book. it's a magical device that allows you to signal during day and night far further than you normally wood, it's basically indestructible, it takes no effort to use, you can use it continuously pretty much forever without worrying about batteries or whatnot, it's tiny, and it weighs next to nothing. there's no reason not to have it with you besides ignorance. 

# conclusion

that's all i got. like i said, you can disagree on my philosophy but i think everything i wrote above is important to at least consider. this isn't a complete guide obviously. i could write a full post on every survival item mentioned. but it might be a good starting point nonetheless."

Suggestions for teaching kids?,"Ok so I grew up in a remote part of Alaska, and our gym class literally taught us survival. I remember one year being paired during gym class, then being brought outside and we had to “survive”; collect our own firewood, start our own fire, collect snow &amp; melt down to cook ramen noodles. We even had to stick our feet in our partners armpits to warm them up, and this was all in elementary school. We had a rock climbing wall in the gym, went skiing for gym in the winter, hiking trips, all the outdoors stuff. I never really thought much about how different this was until I moved to Indiana and my own kids attended school.

Lately we’ve been going on extended hikes and rock climbing now that my kids are older (6m, 6F, 7F, 12M). My oldest is much more knowledgeable on outdoors safety/survival from boy scouts and spending summers in Alaska with my family, but I’m starting to realize how much my younger kids are lacking. I’m trying to teach the basic safeties (3days without water, 3 weeks without food, what to do if you’re lost, knife safety, etc) but I’m honestly so lost LOL. I saw someone’s post on here about gear for young kids, and followed the comments taking notes. I think I’ve got the gear &amp; “hug a tree” thing down, I just want to know if anyone has suggestions/experience with what they’ve taught their kids at this age? I mean obviously we’re extremely careful when we’re out; one parent is always in front and one behind, so most of this is just precautionary lessons, but I also want my kids to carry their skills into adulthood. I learned so much growing up in Alaska and it really put a impact on my love AND respect for the outdoors, I want the same for them.

lately we’ve been going on extended hikes and rock climbing now that my kids are older (6m, 6f, 7f, 12m). my oldest is much more knowledgeable on outdoors safety/survival from boy scouts and spending summers in alaska with my family, but i’m starting to realize how much my younger kids are lacking. i’m trying to teach the basic safeties (3days without water, 3 weeks without food, what to do if you’re lost, knife safety, etc) but i’m honestly so lost lol. i saw someone’s post on here about gear for young kids, and followed the comments taking notes. i think i’ve got the gear &amp; “hug a tree” thing down, i just want to know if anyone has suggestions/experience with what they’ve taught their kids at this age? i mean obviously we’re extremely careful when we’re out; one parent is always in front and one behind, so most of this is just precautionary lessons, but i also want my kids to carry their skills into adulthood. i learned so much growing up in alaska and it really put a impact on my love and respect for the outdoors, i want the same for them. 

i don’t want to smother them with information, bore them to death and risk none of it sinking in. however, i really want them to be prepared for anything and carry their lessons into adulthood.

How do I start a fire with a lighter?,"I know this sounds dumb, but recently I’ve been learning how to survive in the woods. Now I thought if I got a bic lighter and a knife, it would be super easy to start a fire. But, one could say I was arrogant. This morning I went into the woods with a bic lighter and a knife. I had previously taken down a big limb of a pine tree (about 8 ft tall) for another reason. The tree was on the ground for about 2 weeks, wasn’t rotten just freshly dead. I cut the bark off, then cut some kindling off the pine tree. I got some kindling and some twigs, and went to light the kindling on fire. The kindling would barely catch on fire, I would put the kindling in the actual fire with some more kindling, but the kindling wouldn’t catch and and I tried blowing on it and putting more twigs on the kindling, but the fire ran out. I tried adding paper but nothing worked. 

I know this sounds stupid, but why can’t I make fire. I can’t find any videos on it, because it feels like a really easy task. 

Summary, how do I start fire with a bic lighter in Kentucky.

Are tree house shelters viable?,"Are tree house shelters viable? What are the pros and cons? I haven't seen much, if any at all about making shelters in trees, so im curious to see if this method has had any development and what the general lines of thought are...

for the short term, this could be as simple as a nailed in ladder leading up to a small platform for a 1 person tent. But eventually this could turn into a full covered wooden room

here's my speculative assessment

pros:
- gets you off the ground from all wildlife, including bears and all the rest, you have a better chance of defending yourself with a height advantage, and they will have to use all their limb to get up to you

- gets you out of sight from the eye level observer, very stealthy

- psychological advantage of being hidden and protected, this can be a huge bonus depending on your mental health

- no chance of flooding 

cons:
- Requires more tools, nails, hammers, axe to chop wood, and more experience, vs just setting up your tent on the ground

- physically demanding to climb up and down every day, this could add up if you are older, and if you are injured could be life threatening

- always risk of falling, even how small the chance, its a possibility

- finding the right tree will be much harder than even finding a good place for a hammock

- unlikely but still possible: windy conditions destroying the tree, and/ or shelter

Existential Question-When Surviving?,"Hello Survivors! I am here to ask a question regarding the natural state of existence, how we interpret this existence. This will be used for a survey in my Statistics class. 
My question: Do you believe a higher power* exists?

*For Clarification, I will define a higher power as an energetic principle that assists in the procreation and continuance of life. Or, an intelligence that participated in the development of the world as we understand it. A creative life force!
Please let me know by yes/no answers, but feel free to explain why! I am curious what y’all feel. 

I feel that this is related to general survival,  because I think our interpretation of universal existence and our place within this world is often what keeps us going.

I am not sure how closely you have been following the cryptocurrency news recently. In case you have not joined the Pi Network yet, I am sending you an invitation.  
 

Pi is a new digital currency introduced on Pi Day (3/14) in 2019. It is a new type of blockchain technology developed at Stanford. It uses smartphones instead of computers. The ""mining"" process for each coin does not require solving puzzles, wasting energy, or using your phone data. You just mine it by tapping the app once a day to confirm you are human.  
 

As part of your invitation, I am sending you 1π!

To claim your Pi, download the Pi Network app (on an iPhone or Android device) and use my username (DrEEEEE) as your invitation code.  
 

Pi is not a scam. You can Google it, search for the core team members and view their published articles and citations on Google Scholar, view their social media to confirm network growth and updates, watch countless videos from many trusted sources explaining the technology and concept. The Pi Network channel on Youtube is hosted by the founders explaining the network and technology in the videos. You should also check out the comments and questions below those videos to see the intense enthusiasm and interest in this new project. Once you download the app, you can also view the latest information and messages from core team members, who are all Standford University Ph.D. and MBA recipients. The founder, my colleague Dr. Kokkalis, lectures a cryptocurrency course at Stanford, so their updates include the videos of these lectures as well. I have learned quite a lot from them just in the past few weeks since I joined.  
 

The network is growing quickly. It reached 14 million members last month. The core team members plan to close the network and end the mining process when the network reaches around 100 million members. At that time, you will be able to trade the Pi you have mined for actual currencies, just like Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. The members of the network will also be rewarded for any transaction fees collected and advertising revenue from their app. Also, their network is already open to programmers to develop apps specific to that network. All of the revenue generated will also be shared with the network members daily. The daily active users and the large ecosystem created by the network give Pi a certain value other cryptocurrencies do not possess.  
 

Pi was launched as a three-phase project. The first phase involved growing the network and mining a limited number of coins. The second phase of testing the network is already running. The third and final phase will be Mainnet. This is the phase where you can actually trade the Pi you have earned. The Mainnet phase is expected to be launched within months.   
 

As the network expands, the mining rate (currently 0.1 Pi per hour) is cut in half at each benchmark, such as 10 million, 100 million members, etc. This halving is intended to create the ""scarcity"" concept. Similar to Bitcoin, the total number of Pi created will be limited. I am sure you have heard the Bitcoin halving (mining rate being cut in half) last year created enormous demand, sending the price of one Bitcoin to over $61K recently! At this time, we don't know exactly how much each Pi will be worth once trading starts at the third phase of the project. Estimates range from a few cents to a few dollars per Pi. However, it is not unusual for a new cryptocurrency to experience 100 or even 1000-fold increases in value within a year. In case you are not familiar with cryptocurrency values, you can search historical prices for Bitcoin and Ether to see these exponential increases.

 Once you join the network, you will also be receiving 25% of the Pi I am mining daily as a bonus. This also applies to everyone who joins your team in the future. This incentive structure has helped them grow their network so quickly. The app also allows you to see how much your ""team"" is mining in real-time. Pretty exciting and engaging, in my opinion. You can currently mine almost 3 Pi a day with just me as your one team member to start. If you have a decent size network, that number can get much higher.  
 

Feel free to read the FAQ and white paper explaining the concept on their secure website, minepi dot com. Once you download the app you will need the invitation code DrEEEEE to create your account, since every member needs an invitation to sign up. When you accept you will see me listed as a verified member, under your Earning Team.  
 

Keep in mind that they are planning to close the network when they reach around 100 million members and the Pi mining rate will eventually be reduced to zero, limiting the total number of Pi in circulation and increasing the value of each Pi mined until then. The network growth rate so far seems to be around 20% a month and Pi already has more daily active users than any other cryptocurrency!   
 

If you have any questions about Pi, the technology, digital currencies, or finance in general, I am happy to help any time.  
 

Happy mining 😊",0,1622404785,Michael_Williams_76,0,1,True,2021-05-30,"the latest silicon valley project...

I survived a death roll/drowning attempt from a gator on memorial day weekend.," I don't know where else to post this but here I will. My small boat overturned while I was down in Florida this memorial day weekend. On Sunday May 30, 2021, I thought I was going to die. Was on a fishing trip in an open channel that lead to the swamps. Great fishing spot, my boat is small and the day was done as it was going to get dark soon in about an hour or so. I already knew I was in gator infested waters and its crazy as I was leaving I thought nothing of the massive Gators in/out of the water and near it's banks. I was carrying too much weight on the boat and was caught off guard when trying to make a sharp turn. The boat overturns and capsizes as the equipment and everything goes under. About 400-500 metters or so was the boat dock. And all I heard when I got thrown into the water was ""swim"" ""swim"" here!!!! And I look to my left and I see what looks to be a dinosaur head right above the skim of the water heading towards me, this Gators head was huge. The gator had to be at least 10 feet. I can't officially say I'm military but I am a Navy seal reject/quitter. If that counts for anything. I went to the Navy at 18 and tried to do the buds program and long story short it was too tough for me and I had to quit. But I had some training for stress situations. 

Back to the story 

I swam as fast as I could, and I quickly realized I wasn't going to make it to the dick before getting attacked. I took some deep breaths as I awaited for the inevitable chomp. I knew I had a couple last breaths to take before I go under. The gator comes in and immediately bites my waist I couldn't help but yell out a screech. The gator came at me with so much force in a dart like movement that when it bit me its tail went in the air and it did a flip like roll. Next thing I know I was under the water. Right before I went under thank good I took in a last breath right after my screeching. I remained calm as much as I could, instinct took over. I felt around its head because I knew it wouldn't let go, I felt it's skin to make a visual map and used my hands to travel towards it's eyes. Once I could make out it's eye balls (and remember at this point the gator is swimming franticly and already did 2-3 rolls). I locate it's eyes and I gauge them out. It releases hold and swims away. I then try swimming back and all I could remember was slowly drifting off as if I was falling asleep. I then woke up in the hospital and was told I survived a gator attack and almost bled to death. I have an interview with the news tommorow for all who wish to know more!

Does anybody know more about foraging ragweed and crabgrass?,"Giant ragweed is a common edible plant and a forgotten grain that used to be cultivated but is now considered a pest.

Everything I need for 72 Hours in the forest?,"Hi,

I and a close friend want to try ""Surviving"" in the forest (southwest England) for a few days. I say surviving in quotations because we won't be too far away from civilization and we won't be gone long enough to be in any danger. I and my friend have always wanted to do this and we will probably just do 24 hours to begin with as this seems more sensible. This will most likely turn into a little hobby of ours that we get better and better at and go for longer to take breaks from this crazy world. We're used to camping in tents but we want to make our own shelter, our own fire, catch our own food and collect our own water.. you know, earn some useful life skills.

&amp;#x200B;

So we're coming to the experts for a full tool or kit list we may need? We're not disregarding the use of any tools or equipment while we're still new. We're happy to use flint and steel. axe, knife, etc. Just not a shelter or a cooker or anything to sleep in. We want to figure this out ourselves! 

&amp;#x200B;

As well as a tool/ equipment list. Are there any books we should take a look at for learning too? Basic surviving books. How to light a fire without tools, how to purify water safely, how to keep safe from the unique English environment, and so on. We're both very excited as we're both nature enthusiasts and camp out frequently. We're both 24 but you don't learn this set of skills in school!

Short Film Research,"Hello, community, I apologize if this is not the place,

But I am an ex-pat film student currently based in Poland and I am writing a short film about two broken men (stepfather and stepson) who couldn't be more different but end up overcoming their differences as they gather for burying their respective wife and mother,

I am writing this because I am doing research on the older man, he is a 60-year-old survivalist who lives in the woods and although not completely isolated, he does his best to avoid going to town.

My question is if are there common myths that I should avoid, or specific things that I shouldn't miss about him

Like his belongings, such as a favorite handy tool or way of doing things this character should or could have. Also, grievances that would be a source of conflict with people who don't understand this mindset, would there be some kind of prejudice, comment, or misconception that would specifically upset this man, in relation to his philosophy and lifestyle?

Additionally, if there is a similar personality or book that someone could recommend me so I can be truly faithful and delve deep into this world I would be extremely grateful and credits will be given at the end of the project,

like his belongings, such as a favorite handy tool or way of doing things this character should or could have. also, grievances that would be a source of conflict with people who don't understand this mindset, would there be some kind of prejudice, comment, or misconception that would specifically upset this man, in relation to his philosophy and lifestyle?

additionally, if there is a similar personality or book that someone could recommend me so i can be truly faithful and delve deep into this world i would be extremely grateful and credits will be given at the end of the project,

thank you and best regards everyone."

"Lyme Disease: what I didn’t know, and maybe you don’t either.","I commented on a recent post with the suggestion that the OP needed to be careful about ticks and Lyme disease where they were planning to do their woodland survival exercise (Southern England) and ask a doctor for advice if they didn’t spot and remove a tick within 24 hours. That prompted another commenter to disagree and say that according to CDC, 36-48 hours was the safe window for removing a tick and avoiding Lyme. I’d seen both 24 and 48 hours before, on different NHS websites, so we went back and forth a bit about our interpretation of NHS and CDC guidance, which made me dig deeper into the studies and sources which lie behind the public health guidance on Lyme disease, in the UK and US. I half expected to find I was wrong and apologise; turns out we were both wrong and it’s a little bit scary. 

Those experiments and studies didn’t show that Lyme always takes 24 hours or 36 hours or 48 hours to pass into your bloodstream. If a tick has Lyme on its mouthparts, which they can do if they’ve recently been feeding before transferring to you, it can infect you much, much faster. 

Removing a tick quickly does substantially reduce the risk of transmission, but:

There is no ‘safe window’ of time in which you can pull off a Lyme carrying tick and be 100% sure you’re not infected.

Rashes and fever are typical early symptoms but between 7% and 30% of people affected don’t show them. In the US the CDC estimates that up to 476,000 people are infected with Lyme each year. 15 times the number that are properly diagnosed and treated. This may be because following the current guidelines causes many people to believe they’re safer than they are.

Untreated Lyme can produce serious long term health problems, there is a vaccine being tested right now but in the meantime the key is protection and avoidance. 

I’m not going to recommend any particular products but look up effective repellents, also non toxic, non grip sprays for animal fur that stop ticks getting a hold, also think about clothing choices and tick hooks and other removers. Check yourself daily with a mirror if in Lyme tick country. Check your animals.

Stay safe out there.

Questions about emergency survival food,So the past few months I’ve been on here asking questions and attempting to improve my chances of survival in common situations that can happen to anyone.  Now the question I’ve been wanting to ask is about foods. In my survival bag I carry two 2400 calories ration bars. I’ve been contemplating replacing them with a MRE or two. But I want to ask you guys some ideas for lightweight emergency food. I know that it is technically the least important as you can survive weeks without eating but for me it’s more about the calories it’s energy and that’s something that concerns me should I just keep the calorie bars as in most cases 4800 cali can be 2-3 days worth of calories that can either get you out of a short term situation or allow you to prepare for longer.

What can I use for a backwoods fishing setup?,"I live in NW Oregon, I have a creek with small trout, and a wide variety of native plants.

Classifying survival kits in terms of size," 

So I have been thinking about survival kits a bit recently and what different types and sizes there is. So far I feel like the most common theme is there is overall 4 size levels to consider:

1. In pocket/On person, goal is maximum utility at minimum size so it can be in the pocket at all times. Micro survival kits, altoids tins and so on. You would want better kits, but this is the absolute smallest you can make it while enchanting your survival.
2. In bag. That is, a kit that can be carried in your backpack or purse in addition to what you normally carry in there, so not the size of a backpack but rather meant to be in it . A small survival kit but with a bit more room. Basically the smallest you can make a real survival kit.

3. In vehicle. What you would have say, in your car. A  survival kit the size of backpack, likely is a backpack in fact, or maybe a duffel bag. Contains more or less everything you would want for an emergency or survival in the medium term.
4. Leave at home. Basically, any kits to large to fit in a backpack, so boxes or what you will have in a room. You got everything you need here for survival in the long term.

Of course, all of this is a continuum but I felt it would be an interesting exercise to try and create some basic classification.

So 1 in particular and (smaller) 2 would be something you can reasonable carry with you in your pockets and/or in everyday life. 1 being small enough to always have on you (pocket size and smaller) while the 2 are more to keep in backpacks and such that you don't always carry with you but might often do (So larger pocket size, lunchbox and large first aid kids). while 3 (and larger 2's) is backpack size and is what you would keep in your car or other places with some but not a lot of space like a room and while its not something you necessarily always carry with its the largest form that you can carry around with you in the given situation its made for. 4 would be the most extensive forms of kits that you would consider and not the type you can carry around in generally Basically large boxes and even rooms containing everything you need",0,1621610177,hostergaard,6,1,True,2021-05-21,"classifying survival kits in terms of size  

so i have been thinking about survival kits a bit recently and what different types and sizes there is. so far i feel like the most common theme is there is overall 4 size levels to consider:

1. in pocket/on person, goal is maximum utility at minimum size so it can be in the pocket at all times. micro survival kits, altoids tins and so on. you would want better kits, but this is the absolute smallest you can make it while enchanting your survival.
2. in bag. that is, a kit that can be carried in your backpack or purse in addition to what you normally carry in there, so not the size of a backpack but rather meant to be in it . a small survival kit but with a bit more room. basically the smallest you can make a real survival kit. sizes vary between large matchbox to lunchbox and up to like a toiletry bag or maybe first aid kit. basically, you them in your purse, backpack, glovebox or whatever together with other stuff.

So my question is: Would any of you guys and gals have an interest in a Crocheted 550 Paracord braid/net/bag that had a couple 400-500 rated carabiners weaved in? They'd be able to quickly deconstruct when needed by removing the carabiners and pulling a cord straight down the length and I found it really interesting and cool.

My son and I took a survival class this past weekend...,"I’ve been interested in survival for probably the past 14 years. I’ve seen all the shows, have read several books and have read hundreds of articles, but I’ve never put anything into practice. 
My 10 year old son and I took a survival class at the Midwest Native Skills Institute here in Ohio over the weekend and we had a great experience. I’ve been wanting to take his edible &amp; medicinal plants classes as well as survival class for a good 10 years now and finally got around to it. Do I wish I would have sooner? Nah, now my son was able to experience it and learn as well. I now have down pat about 5-6 very common plant and “weeds” out there that I know I can eat as well as use medicinally or even use to thicken a stew. I’ll be expanding upon this knowledge in the summer and fall plants classes as well where I’m hoping to have solid first hand knowledge of at least 15 plants by the time I’m done. I don’t want to know every single plant and tree out there, I just want to know the ones that I know I’ll use and are common around here and I’m on my way there. 
At the survival class we learned several ways to make fire. After years of wanting to know how, I finally made a fire with a bow drill. I actually cried after succeeding, the feeling you get from making a fire that way is indescribable.  Learned how to make several types of effective traps, how to move in nature without startling animals, how to use “wide angle” vision rather than tunnel vision and walk in a way to become a grey man. Learned many, many ways to make shelters, including ones that will keep you warm at 20 degrees. It was a memorable experience and I finally feel like I can apply all the book knowledge I’ve accumulated over the years into real life situations. We will be going on little survival camping trips this summer to practice what we’ve learned.

"Weighing the options for safe drinking water while backpacking, care to weigh in? What is your plan A and why?","I’m planning on doing some week long back-packing or possible kayak camping. New York States or New Jersey. 

I can’t realistically carry ten days worth of water.

It will be my first time back packing, and I’m not sure which option is best. TLDR at the end.

weighing the following options: 1) boiling water each day, for daily use... 2) using a sawyer mini to filter out bacteria and UV to kill viruses.... or 3) a sawyer purifier to remove bacteria, viruses, and even chemicals pollutants.

1) Boiling water seems most foolproof, cheapest option, and effective for all pathogens. But it does nothing for non-organic contaminants like lead, etc. if oil go this route, how do I determine which water sources aren’t going to poison me with industrial runoff or some shit?

2) seems affordable, and user friendly. But doesn’t remove viruses. If I’m gathering water where other people have been ill probably guzzle noroviruses and get diarrhea in the wilderness. No thanks. But... how do I purify with UV? Just leave a clear bottle out in the sun while I hike? I mean, I can’t see UV so I can’t guess what it can penetrate- plastics, glass... what kind of bottle is conducive to UV sterilization?

3) most expensive option, but it seems almost entirely worth free. But I don’t want to spend money on a thing I can only use a couple hundred times or whatever and then have to replace.

4) I deliberately left the chemical tablets option off the list. I’m going to bring a few with me in case whatever other option I use as a first choice fails. But I hate the taste of chemically treated tap water so I don’t think I want to rely on that unless I really must.

5) I didn’t think of this until just now, but sunlight penetrates open water, if i only gather water from the top centimeter of a lake or something, would it be partially UV zapped? (I know currents constantly stir that shit up, just wondering if it makes any difference) 

6) I’ve also thought about setting up a tarp trap for rain waters and what not, to refill a jug without needing to purify. But then I’m really at the mercy of the elements and i might try that for fun, but It wouldn’t be reliable as a plan A.

The compass can be used to determine the direction to North, and when combined with the GPS it can be used to navigate to predefined locations. The predefined locations, known as beacons, can be created while at a location and at any point you can use the compass to navigate back to where the beacon was placed. You can also use Backtrack to record waypoints and retrace your steps.  


Weather  
The barometer can be used to determine if the weather will change soon and if a storm is likely to occur. The barometric pressure history (last 48 hours) is displayed as a graph and an interpretation of the current reading is shown. If the pressure suddenly drops, a storm alert notification is sent. Note, this feature is only available for phones which have a barometer.

A post about true longevity.,"How reasonable do you think it would be to buy a plot of land with a substantial amount of iron ore, then one with a substantial amount of oil.

I survived 4 days lost in Big Bend National Park.,"Let's go back to 2009. 
I was then, Mid 20's excellent physical condition. With many many miles of trails under my belt.  At this point I had successfully thru hiked the Vermont Long trail, section hiked the AT, rafed the lenght of the Yukon river, but had spent little to no time in the deserts. 
After seeing photos and reading while reports, I new Big Bend was my next hike. 
I chose the Mesa de Anguila trail as my first hike.
Remote, and isolated from the rest of Big Bend National Park, the spectacular Mesa de Anguila offers an opportunity for solitude in an area with exceptional views. Beginning just below Lajitas on its upper end, the mesa runs some eleven miles in a southeasterly direction, reaching a high point near its middle of 3,883 feet above sea level and ending in high, sheer cliffs at the mouth of Terlingua Creek on the Rio Grande. On its southern exposure the mesa drops precipitously in walls some 1,500 feet high to form the United States side of Santa Elena Canyon.
The Mesa is one of the least visited areas of Big Bend National Park. The Mesa de Anguila trailhead is accessed from Lajitas, TX, 21 miles west of Big Bend National Park's west entrance.
11 miles is an easy day hike for me.  My plans were to hike in, spend the night over looking the river, then hike out the following day. 
Packing 2.5 gallons of water put more weight in my pack than I was use to, but the park requires 1 gallon per day so I brought extra. This is the only thing I done right. 
The first day and night was amazing. It was November, so day time temperatures were in the 80s .
Being from Louisiana 80 degrees wasn't hot, but the dry air was something to get use to. 
I spent the day slowly making my way to the Rio Grand, then spent the night on a bluff overlooking the river. It was spectacular. The next morning I pack up, to head back, was planning to do some more day hiking in the interior of the park. 
The morning was going good, then out of nowhere it hit me, I had not seen a carin in a good while. 
( If you are unfamiliar, a carin is a stack of rocks or stone placed beside a trail to mark the trail in placed with no trees ect.)
For an un known about of time, I wondered off the trail and was following a game or animal trail. 
This is where things went really south, and I earned my idiot merit badge.  I had purchased my first smart phone two weeks prior.  I didn't bring my GPS because the iPhone had one. I didn't bring a compass because the phone had one.  I was trying to save weight because of the extra water. 
I took out the phone, turned it on pulled up the GPS quadrants, plotted them on the map and it placed me square in the parking lot where I left my truck. 
The original smart phones gps didn't work with no phone service.  Turned on the compass function to try to dead reacon position, comaspas on the phone was just spinning in circles.  And obvious second stupid move, I threw the phone down and stumped on it out of anger. How could I be so stupid to substitute 2 critia pieces of equipment for a stupid phone. 
I picked up my gear and back tracked. I figured surely I would just go backwards and find the trail. After hours of walking the sun started to set and i made camp, clueless about where exactly i was. 
The next morning I woke up and ate my last freeze dried meal, another stupid decision as it used up precious water that I was now dangerously close to being out of. 
I picked up my gear, decided I was going to walk in as strait a line as possible and just find my way out. By noon I was completely out of water.  At around 2 p.m I sat down under a shaded spot took out my journal and pen and wrote my "" if you find me this is what happend note, tell my parents I love them, ect. Ect.""  Hardest thing iv ever written on paper. 
Shortly after I shook my self together and decided I wasnt dieing out their.  I stayed under the rock face until dark.  At dark I gathered my gear and started walking. 
A few hours in and I stumpled upon a dry creek bed.  It was dry, but it was the motivation I needed.  Water goes down stream, and down stream is the Rio Grand I told my self. I followed it until I come upon a crater in the creek that held about a gallon water. I filtered it and thanked the heavens as I drank it.  
I spent the rest of the night and the better part of the next morning there, resting. 
The next day I started down the creek again.   By high noon I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. Water. Lots and lots of water.  It wasnt a trick, it was the rio grand. To date that was the nastiest water I had ever drank.  But I was thankful to have it. 
I decided I would stay on the river from that point on. If nothing else I had water. I knew Lajitas was up stream and that give me hope.  Fast forward to day 3 lost, day 5 on the trail.  I woke on the river bank to an un easy feeling. I opened by eyes and was staring at a mule. When I sat up I noticed there was over a dozen mules. They were all drinking from the river, and there were 6 Men standing around me. 2 of them had rifles across there backs, they all had side arms. 
The fear in my face must had been apparent, because the only one who spoke English, very broken English said "" it's ok gringo, you come with us."" 
At this point I didn't know if I was being kidnapped or rescued, but I didn't care. They had water. They fed me.  They put my gear on the back of one mule, placed me on another, and we all rode.  
A few hours elapsed an we were met with an old truck. I was told to get in, 3 of the men got in the bed of the truck with me, 3 stayed with the mules and went their own way.  That night I found my self in the town of Boquillas delta Carmen.  They fed me and gave me water. 
After the meal one instructed me to get my gear, walked me out side and point up the road and simply said, ""go that way"". 
After a short walk I was back at the rio grand, looking across the river I seen an obvious park overlook.  I crossed the river to be met by some extremely curious tourists. They give me a ride to the ranger station. 
After talking to one of the rangers for well over an hour, he simply looked at me and said ""you should be dead, people die in this park for much less.""

i picked up my gear, decided i was going to walk in as strait a line as possible and just find my way out. by noon i was completely out of water.  at around 2 p.m i sat down under a shaded spot took out my journal and pen and wrote my "" if you find me this is what happend note, tell my parents i love them, ect. ect.""  hardest thing iv ever written on paper. 
shortly after i shook my self together and decided i wasnt dieing out their.  i stayed under the rock face until dark.  at dark i gathered my gear and started walking. 
a few hours in and i stumpled upon a dry creek bed.  it was dry, but it was the motivation i needed.  water goes down stream, and down stream is the rio grand i told my self. i followed it until i come upon a crater in the creek that held about a gallon water. i filtered it and thanked the heavens as i drank it.  
i spent the rest of the night and the better part of the next morning there, resting. 
the next day i started down the creek again.   by high noon i thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. water. lots and lots of water.  it wasnt a trick, it was the rio grand. to date that was the nastiest water i had ever drank.  but i was thankful to have it. 
i decided i would stay on the river from that point on. if nothing else i had water. i knew lajitas was up stream and that give me hope.  fast forward to day 3 lost, day 5 on the trail.  i woke on the river bank to an un easy feeling. i opened by eyes and was staring at a mule. when i sat up i noticed there was over a dozen mules. they were all drinking from the river, and there were 6 men standing around me. 2 of them had rifles across there backs, they all had side arms. 
the fear in my face must had been apparent, because the only one who spoke english, very broken english said "" it's ok gringo, you come with us."" 
at this point i didn't know if i was being kidnapped or rescued, but i didn't care. they had water. they fed me.  they put my gear on the back of one mule, placed me on another, and we all rode.  
a few hours elapsed an we were met with an old truck. i was told to get in, 3 of the men got in the bed of the truck with me, 3 stayed with the mules and went their own way.  that night i found my self in the town of boquillas delta carmen.  they fed me and gave me water. 
after the meal one instructed me to get my gear, walked me out side and point up the road and simply said, ""go that way"". 
after a short walk i was back at the rio grand, looking across the river i seen an obvious park overlook.  i crossed the river to be met by some extremely curious tourists. they give me a ride to the ranger station. 
after talking to one of the rangers for well over an hour, he simply looked at me and said ""you should be dead, people die in this park for much less."" 
i have scine been back to big bend every other year. 
it is the grandest place i have ever visited, and it has my total and upmost respect."

Aluminum vs. Steel “tuna cans” for alcohol stoves,"So I basically have (besides aluminum beverage cans, which I actually have another question about I’m going to research and then post on if I can’t find a good answer) two types of “tuna can” style containers- actual tuna cans, which in this case are made of steel (or enough steel that a magnet will stick to them), and a couple of sizes of cat food cans that are made of aluminum (in anecdotal evidence I may say that these waste away slightly faster with repeated use, but I’m a rookie to this for sure, so I really can’t say).  Basically, is there any difference in application or, you know, design, care, anything, between the two metals when used for camp stoves, or am I thinking too hard?  I feel like there must be some real survival heads who will have some opinions on this subject, although I wasn’t able to find a thread asking this particular question :p

Why Do Some Woods Burn Better?,"&amp;#x200B;

![img](fkhkp8p4e5z61 ""Every type of wood is made up of the same building blocks, which includes compounds like lignin and cellulose. What differs is the space between wood fibers and how much moisture and air the wood contains.

The woods known as hardwoods don't have a lot of space between their fibers. They're extremely dense and heavy, which means that a fire built with hardwoods has a lot of fuel to burn through.

As a result, hardwoods burn slowly and

produce substantial amounts of heat. That's why you'll see them listed as some of the best kinds of woods to burn:

* White oak
* Red oak
* Shagbark hickory
* Apple

Softwoods are less dense and won't burn as long as hardwoods. However, because they burn so quickly, they're often considered great for starting a fire:

# White birch
# American cherry
# Cedar

Conifers like pine trees are considered to have soft wood, so they also will make for low-burning logs. Pine logs in particular contain high amounts of sap and so might be messy to burn, especially if they haven't been properly seasoned.

No matter which types of wood you burn, there are important safety tips to keep in mind:

✓ If burning wood inside, have your chimney inspected and cleaned annually

✓ Use a carbon monoxide detector when burning wood inside, and never burn green, unseasoned wood inside due to the increased carbon monoxide risk.

✓ Avoid burning treated lumber, as it can contain potentially toxic chemicals

With these safety tips in mind and the right type of wood in your firewood rack, you can look forward to making any season bright.

Why does fire seem to be top of so many lists?,"When it comes to prioritizing food/water/shelter/fire, I see most people place ""fire"" at the top of their lists. Maybe it's because of my own experiences and preferences or maybe I'm missing something, but I have a tough time seeing how that would be the top priority for most people in most situations.

I go over example scenarios in my head (absenting very particular exceptions like injury or mudslide) and can't see how fire would be a #1 must have over other needs, like:

* North America, medium-density (or more) forest, spring to fall (i.e. nighttime temperatures above zero) --&gt; shelter seems like the first priority to guard against bugs, animals and the elements. Water would be a close second, as you could crudely purify it without needing to boil it.
* Desert --&gt; depending on the terrain and/or season, it'd be a toss up between water and shelter being first priorities. If nightfall is approaching with a rapid temperature drop, definitely shelter. If it's the middle of the day with a blazing sun overhead, water, unless needing shelter overrides the need for hydration.
* Winter --&gt;  definitely shelter should be the first option, as you can only survive a few hours exposed to the elements. If it's snowy, that could help a great deal in insulating a shelter AND providing water. I know the obvious answer is ""fire keeps you warm"", but I've enjoyed many fires outside in the winter and I'm still cold.

I'm not at all discounting the value of fire, as it can help boil water, cook food, dry clothes, provide heat and light, protect against animals, etc. But it doesn't seem as *essential* as water or shelter in survivalism. You usually can't transport fire (unless you've made a torch) for light and protection, it has to be quite sizeable to provide adequate warmth, and it can take valuable energy/resources away from  other things needed to keep you alive out there.",0,1619802876,making_mischief,50,1,True,2021-04-30,"why does fire seem to be top of so many lists? when it comes to prioritizing food/water/shelter/fire, i see most people place ""fire"" at the top of their lists. maybe it's because of my own experiences and preferences or maybe i'm missing something, but i have a tough time seeing how that would be the top priority for most people in most situations.

Has anyone tried using a Dakota Fire Hole with a trench and cover to keep a fire going in the rain?,"It's been raining a few days down here in Texas, and I've been thinking of different ways to have a fire pit in the backyard. I could lay the wood in an a-fram and keep wood on top to keep it going. But that takes a lot of wood. I want to try and use as little wood as I can.

Animal attack survival question,"I have read and unfortunately seen stories and pictures of people who have survived animal attacks from bears, cougars and the like.

He is my question. Have there been any legitimate cases of attacks where the person has been able to fend off the animal with let’s say, a big hunting knife? While being attacked, the person being able to injure the animal enough that the animal retreats?

Just morbid curiosity.

Thanks.

Excellent survival book and resource list &amp; link," [https://imgur.com/a/WxrH4zX](https://imgur.com/a/WxrH4zX)   
I note there are several threads on here regarding survival books and other information.  My personal recommendation for a primary Survival book is Cody Lundin's ""***98.6 degrees, The art of keeping your ass alive.***""  For a beginner book, it's one of the best.  Great information.  Well put together, highly readable and hard to put down.  Bear in mind, it is a beginners level book, but it has a few photos and drawings.  It pokes a bit of fun at itself, and is one of the best.

Survival books as we know them today, have a fairly recent history, with the first dedicated books being published in the late 1960's.  This is excluding military manuals, which are frankly the most boring and dull things I've read since a drivers Ed manual in the early 70's.  Although good books, they tend to be a bit dry.  Books such as, ***The Survival Book,*** by Nesbitt, Ponds and Allen in 1959.  ***How to survive on Land and Sea***, by Frank C. Craighead Ph.d was published by the U.S. Naval Institute and used for a time by the Naval aviation training program in 1943 and is still considered a classic. It has been updated repeatedly.   ***Surviving a Wilderness Emergency*** by Peter Kummerfeldt is another excellent tome, released in 2006

For a reasonably comprehensive list of survival books with editorial commentary, I suggest the Equipped to survive list of books at:

[http://www.equipped.com/books.htm#deepsurvival](http://www.equipped.com/books.htm#deepsurvival)

There are several categories of books including: General survival, Disaster survival, Water &amp; marine survival, medical, urban survival, and desert survival. Great site.

What are some good natural roof materials?," Hey guys I plan to build a semi-permanent shelter on my land and am currently undecided what to make the roof out of. I was thinking about using tree bark or maybe making wooden roof tiles but I never tried that before. I don't think layered pine branches or debris would work well for me in the long term since the needles would fall off/rot away. One Idea is to cut boards and layer them from the bottom up so rain would drain down them but I am not sure how waterproof that is.

Of course I could just put a tarp under it and then put whatever looks good on top but I wanna try natural materials first.

Anything you guys have made good experiences with?

Paracord is wildy overrated,"I don't get the love for it. Actually I despise it.
 For me, the normal cord used for sailing and climbing is superior in almost every way. 
First of all it's way stronger. 4mm Cord can hold up to 450kg but the 4mm 550 Paracord only 250kg. 

The inner strands of Paracord is also way to loose inside the sheath. The core can shift inside the sheath and thus experiences  permanent kinks very easy.
Because it flattens in knotd they are also hard to untie.
And knots slip alot because the sheath is so smooth.
Cord on the other hand is very solid. The sheath and core is one union that can't move independently. This makes it longer lasting and knots easier to untie. The rougher surface prevents slipping of knots alot better.
It's also possible to remove the core for sewing although not as easily as with paracord.
Cord is also static unlike paracord,  which flexes alot when loaded. So if u need  tension for a hammock or smth paracord just sucks because it's stretches so much. I can't think of any application where this flex is beneficial. Maybe when hanging a tarp you could reduce stress on the system. But paracord is overkill for a tarp, just use some tiny and lighter 2mm cord  that allows better tensioning while being plenty strong enough.

This is how much of water you can collect from dew from 2 meter square of grass,"Hello good evening to this Reddit. Me I am trying out all kind of survival skill things, so I do have a idea of things before a survival necessity. This morning I did try the dew collecting for to get water.

Building vs carrying shelter for emergency use.,"Shelter can be the most important short term survival need. Without it we can die in a few hours.

Many people like to carry a small pocket sized survival kit and rely on their skills to construct a shelter from natural materials if an emergency arises. There  are lots of books and plenty of YT videos showing how to do it, and it can seem like the convenience of a mini kit is worth the effort of construction if needed. But there’s a problem with that strategy. 

Building a properly wind and waterproof shelter takes a long time and a lot of energy. 

A debris shelter is the quickest and most efficient style, with a simple frame, but it needs around 2 1/2 to 3 feet of debris to effectively block prolonged, heavy rain. Building one properly takes typically 3 hours, if all the materials are close by and you’re practised. Considerably longer if you’re injured and only able to use one hand/arm/leg effectively. This means starting the build 3 hours before dark or before a storm hits. Which is 3 hours less time to walk. It is possible to build a shelter in less time but not one that’s reliably dry in heavy rain.

The ‘Rule of Three’ reminds us that 3 hours of exposure to wind and rain is enough to cause moderate to severe hypothermia. 

The physical effort involved, with lots of bending, raking, scooping and carrying is very similar to ‘light aerobics’ which burns 1200+ calories in 3 hours. So not only are you exposed to wind and rain but also burning valuable calories that you may not be able to replace, especially if relying on wild food like fish or cat tail root which only have 250 calories per kilo. 

The alternative is to carry a shelter, but there again many people prefer to carry the smallest, lightest shelter possible that barely meets the description. A space blanket, disposable poncho or trash bags, for example. The time when we most need shelter is in the worst conditions, and all around wind and water protection is vital in a worst case scenario, so surely it would make good sense to carry a better shelter than a small, open tarp with no groundsheet, for example, even though it’s heavier. 

The US Army has carried out extensive tests to see how much energy is expended when carrying gear, and it turns out that for a moderate load it’s not much. Walking itself is a very efficient mode of travel and carrying a 2 pound shelter only uses an extra 2 calories per hour. That’s only 16 calories over a day’s walk! 

Compared to 3 hours’ work and 1200 calories burned in bad weather, gathering darkness and while possibly injured, an immediate shelter offering real protection in under 5 minutes for only 16 calories is a good deal. 

A 10 pound pack, including food, extra insulation etc, requires only about 13 calories per hour extra, depending on terrain. (Link below.) This means that for a day’s walk the extra effort to carry 10 pounds amounts to only about 75-105 calories. Half a Snickers bar. 

So my point is that in cold, wet weather, when there’s even a small chance of needing proper shelter it’s a much better strategy to carry it than hope to build it. Even if all you can find is a big sheet of scavenged plastic and not an ultralight tent.

many people like to carry a small pocket sized survival kit and rely on their skills to construct a shelter from natural materials if an emergency arises. there  are lots of books and plenty of yt videos showing how to do it, and it can seem like the convenience of a mini kit is worth the effort of construction if needed. but there’s a problem with that strategy. 

building a properly wind and waterproof shelter takes a long time and a lot of energy. 

a debris shelter is the quickest and most efficient style, with a simple frame, but it needs around 2 1/2 to 3 feet of debris to effectively block prolonged, heavy rain. building one properly takes typically 3 hours, if all the materials are close by and you’re practised. considerably longer if you’re injured and only able to use one hand/arm/leg effectively. this means starting the build 3 hours before dark or before a storm hits. which is 3 hours less time to walk. it is possible to build a shelter in less time but not one that’s reliably dry in heavy rain.

I am reposting this as a standard (survey) reminder. Thanks to all of you who have participated so far. Those who have not yet participated, can you please consider doing so? Thank you.

I am teaching the course Social Psychology of Risk offered by Charles Sturt University (Australia) as part of the degree Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation.

While research has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea how participants perceive the associated risks in others activities/sports and, more generally, how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. To this end I have designed a survey and I would like to enlist your kind help.

The survey data will be used by students to design Adventure Outdoor Recreation Programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and I will to use the data to write several research overviews. The background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: [http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html](http://csusap.csu.edu.au/~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html)

If you are over 18 yrs of age, would you mind participating by filling out the survey, please?

The survey can be found at this link:

The survey should take about 20-25 min to complete.

**Mobile device users** please be aware that SurveyMonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll right or down as well to see everything. I apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

I am fully aware that it is a complex and detailed questionnaire, and thus its completion requires some time commitment, but I can assure you that this detail is necessary in order to be able to carry out a nuanced analysis.

Help on building an underground long-term shelter,"I'm  looking for resources on underground shelter-building. Mainly, I'm  looking for something that can be done with purely natural materials,  isn't destructive (doesn't leave a mark that can't be undone), and is,  or can be made, completely invisible.

It  may sound like I'm trying to leech on the land of somebody else, which,  in a way, I am; I'm looking to build myself a semi-permanent shelter on  state-owned land. Where I'm at, this is a legal grey area, so let's not  discuss that too much - it's a risk I'm willing to take. The ethical  question is quite easily solved: there is absolutely no wilderness in my  country not occupied by the state, and land is extremely expensive. The  spot I've chosen is remote and very rarely visited, I will do no harm  to my surroundings and I won't be in the way of anybody. I'm simply  looking to escape the city for a couple of months, and enjoy the nature  that we all have a right to. I have extensive bushcraft experience, and  have built leave-no-trace shelters before in a variety of sizes. The  stealth, underground part is the newly introduced tricky variable.

The difficulties I've come upon are these:

* How will i ensure it doesn't collapse, especially when weighed down by rainwater?
* How  will I keep the insides dry? Is it viable to line the roof with waxed  canvas? Could I possibly use pine branches to guide the water away?
* How difficult will it be to dig? Will I do any damage by cutting roots?
* How deep should I dig to strike the right balance between reliability, warmth and workload?
* Could water seep through the walls of the shelter? How would I go about guiding it away?
* How much building material would I need?

Hypothetical survival situation -finger slice during deadly pandemic.,"Hi everyone I had a hypothetical survival situation come to mind and wanted some opinions on what you would do.

Hypothetically speaking let's imagine someone has a finger slice wound in the joint of the finger. Its deep enough to expose fat and therefore need stitches but not deep enough to see bone. It's a shallow area of skin and the wound is about 1/2"" long and maybe 1/8"" deep. It did not damage ligaments or tendons. The finger had full mobility immediately after the injury. The wound managed to clot after about 15 minutes of pressure. They have antiseptic ointment and bandages, gauze, tape, and a finger splint.

In this scenario I think the person should thoroughly clean the wound, apply the ointment, then create butterfly bandages with the tape to pull the wound shut, cover the finger in gauze, and use the splint to immobilize and help healing. Then change the dressing daily.

What's that Bag for.,"As we often have enthusiastic members requesting we review their bags, I thought I would include an excerpt from my as yet unpublished book.  It concerns some of the different types of bags and how their function changes their ingredients.

  

Types of Emergency Kits/Bags

1. EDC (Every day carry)

a. EDC when camping/hiking or in nature

2. VEDC (Vehicular every day carry)

a. Vehicular emergency

b. Apocalyptic Get back home kit

3. Bug out kits- at home

a. Vehicle BOB

b. Pedestrian BOB

Since there are many emergency scenarios, not all preprepared kits will handle every scenario. The key to managing these many kits is to compartmentalize. Some kits may contain redundant items depending on space available and weight restrictions. Good sources to start building your kits are [https://www.ready.gov/kit](https://www.ready.gov/kit) and [https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/zombie/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/cpr/zombie/index.htm). 

The first determination is whether or not you believe you can return home should apocalypse strike. Two examples that I dealt with at different times of my life are as follows: 1. Working a 30 minute drive from home. Vs 2. Working a 4 hour drive from home. 

In example 1, I was content to have my VEDC and a 1 day Get Back Home kit. The 1 day Get Back Home kit, did not need to contain many items that would be in a pedestrian kit for several days to weeks. And although the VEDC contained “ shelter in” materials the need for living several days to weeks in the vehicle were not a great consideration

In example 2, my Get Back Home kit. And VEDC both considered the possibility of protracted sustained survival with or without the vehicle. 

As you can see from these examples, I list 2 kits in each. In both scenarios the probability of survival and the volume of equipment are greater if I can remain with the vehicle. However, the possibility that loss of, failure of or inability to use the vehicle must be considered necessitating an easily separable pedestrian kit. 

Certain items, such as a heavy-duty (0 deg) sleeping bag, blankets, several extra hats, gloves, outerwear options and several liters of water would likely be too heavy to carry and hike with but may be life savers should the car be stranded in extreme weather such as a snow blizzard. One or more of these items may be grabbed and added to the pedestrian kit depending on conditions.

  

An EDC or every day carry can be broken down to two types of kits. The first is literally something that you carry with you at all time. Standards for most people is relatively small having to be in your pockets or purse. And may contain: Wallet, keys, money, and possibly a pocket knive. Depending on your local, you may also include a defense item such as mace or a handgun. Occasionally people will decide to make little pillbox kits for EDC but often these kits are designed for wilderness survival. 

The Wilderness EDC is somewhat different. It should contain materials to assist in the 4 pillars of survival; Shelter, Fire, Water, Food (in that order). The size of these kits vary. The small pillbox type is best for the day hiker who prefers to go out without a pack.  In the event they were to become stranded, at least they have something. The intentional outdoorsman, who would like to be well prepared should something arise, may want something larger. I prefer a 1 liter molle pouch. This can be included or attached to the pack and removed to attach to the belt should you chose to wander without the rest of your gear.

Next, we have the Vehicular every day carry (VEDC). Depending on the vehicle you drive, you will have some room to store items for an emergency. As stated above these include items that cover a vehicular emergency, such as, breaking down and getting stranded, and a separate bag in case you have to abandon the vehicle.  

The first kit can be considered a “stay with the vehicle, repair the vehicle and alert for help” kit. Many vehicles today have forgone the spare tire for sake of room and weight. You should familiarize yourself with your vehicles flat tire instructions. Adding other items for repair depend on your ability to use them however the ability to jump start should be your next priority. Given todays battery technology, jump starting on your own are now an option. The next consideration is storing items that will allow you to stay with the vehicle without suffering exposure. Such items as blankets, sleeping bags, gloves, coats and hats should be stored depending on climate and available space. Water and food can also be stored in the vehicle for emergencies. Larger tools can be considered however the likelihood of use is low. Next, know where the signal devices are in your vehicle and how to use them. Also inspect these annually to make sure they work when you need them.

The second VEDC kit is the one you will use to walk home should you have to leave your vehicle. This should be included in a single pack and ready to go. Again this depends on the expected trip home. I would recommend a day pack for less than 20 miles and a full trekking pack for greater than 20 miles. The items in the pack may or may not be duplicated in the regular VEDC pack, but it is better to pack necessary items in the Get Back Home bag and remove them if needed rather than find yourself having to quickly pack up items from your VEDC. You are bound to forget something.

  

The next set of kits can vary drastically, depending on space in your home, budget and prepper mind set.

As stated earlier, Bugging out is a risky endeavor, but may become necessary. Should you find you need to do so. There are two kits that you will need to prepare. Just as before the odds are considerably greater should you be able to remain with your vehicle, however should you be forced to abandon it, you will need a rapidly accessible bag that can be carried while hiking or possibly biking depending on distance and local.

Your vehicle can carry a great amount of gear and should allow for redundancy in the case of Bugging out. Most vehicle can hold about 1 week of necessities without restocking. However, it is best to include the gear necessary should you abandon the vehicle. 

If you chose to prep for this possibility, I suggest setting aside boxes of materials and gear that can be rapidly loaded into your vehicle as well as separate packs for each individual.

New guy looking for some tips,"Hello guys,

I'm kinda new to this ""survival"" stuff but I have been hunting several times and I like hiking, but most times on fairly easy grounds, nevertheless I decided to get some extra equipment to make my hiking trips longer (1/2 days) and maybe even sleep in the woods. I live in the Center Region of Portugal which has a Mediterranean biome and the woods are mostly maritime pine and cedro-of-goa with some eucalyptus. 

As I'm new to this I don't really know what I should have on a kit or what equipment and gear I should carry, my original idea was to buy some army surplus (British DPM or German Flektarn), a hunting knife, and a first aid kit. Unfortunately, because of local laws, I can't carry any type of firearm, but wolves haven't been seen in my local woods for some years, we do have boars though. Do you guys know of any good European stores to buy army surplus or what I should always carry? Thanks!

Looking for advice on wild animal encounters while solo camping in wilderness,"I recently realized that I'm lacking some critical information on how to handle certain animal encounters because of a lack of experience or education. 

I've been very fortunate to have limited experiences with aggressive animals but each time I've been pretty stupid upon reflection. I go solo camping quite a bit and have done so for well over a decade in various wilderness areas of Idaho, sometimes backpacking in, sometimes Jeeping in and setting up a hammock or tent next to the Jeep and fire. But rarely do I encounter wild animals that want anything to do with me.

Example one, I had backpacked into a hot spring wilderness area of Idaho in the summer and was sleeping on a mat on the ground in my sleeping bag, no tent. For whatever reason my senses awoke me and I was immediately focused on an area of darkness down the hill in the distance - I guess my ears must have heard an approaching animal. 

As I focused on the area, I could make out a dark figure of some animal (of which I still to this day am unsure of the exact species) sniffing its way up the hill towards me, zig zagging closer and closer until literally it was within a few feet of me. 

At this point I realized it was a pretty damn big beast. What I thought might have been a raccoon or something seemed a lot larger than I expected up close. Maybe a wolverine? This was around 2-3am. Up to this point I had been laying down still, silently in my sleeping bag, at which point I reallly realized how much I had fucked up. 

IF this thing had jumped on me, it would have been a nasty struggle to get out of my sleeping bag and fight properly. I had my knife at my side, but yikes. I think I should have been up and making noise and trying to appear large as soon as I spotted it. 

Fortunately I reacted at this point and grabbed a fist full of dirt/rocks, and tossed it in this creature's face - it sneezed and scrambled off. 

Example two, I have since moved to northern California and was camping on a coastal range, up on a plateau overlooking the ocean. An area I could Jeep into and sling my hammock, but there were fire bans in place (a new form of camping to me, fireless). 

I had camped on this plateau once before and heard a lot of coyotes calling in the night, a familiar and honestly calming experience I enjoy. But I've never ran into coyotes themselves, they always seem to stay away from me even when on nearby hill sides. 

Well, this particular plateau has a LOT of wildlife on it. The Lost Coast in general is an extremely lush place with just, life everywhere. I've seen elk, deer, evidence of bears in the past, and heard coyotes all in a single night, met some baby owls, their parents feinted my Jeep off away to my destined camp site, everywhere I look there is a creature watching my every move.

Late in this night, I decided I was curious about how much wildlife was around me, and walked a bit away from my camp site at the edge of the plateau towards the center of the clearing. And here's where I begin to do stupid things!

I thought it might be interesting to focus my flashlight beam and shine it around all of the edges of the plateau in a 360* arc around me, to see if I could spot any creatures of the night prowling around the perimeter. There were indeed, many sets of eyes peering back at my bright light in the night. 

I couldn't quite tell by the movement patterns of the eyes, if I was looking at deer or coyotes. But they began to pair up and move towards me from different areas of the perimeter in duos. This is where the shivers down my spine began to ran. In a very unique way I felt like I was being circled by predators and corralled in an organized way. 

So I started to quickly walk backwards to my Jeep while continuing to shine my light around to keep note of where each duo was in the night. I thought about turning off my flashlight to see if they would stop following, but for even a moment it was tooooo creepy at that point. 

I fortunately wasn't too far from my Jeep, hopped inside and just chilled the fuck out for a minute. I'm genuinely a very calm person in nature and do not typically feel afraid of whatever wilderness beasts are among me, and feel if I do my part to keep my food contained correctly and leave nature in an untouched way, the creatures will generally keep to themselves and things will be fine. 

But that was a unique experience that lead me to feel like I should seek out a bit of education and not let my hubris of years and years of experience with things always being fine be the reason that I'm unprepared when things are truly not fine. 

I'd love to get a dog and unfortunately cannot with my current living situation.

Texas &amp; Southern States - Water Supply (Business/Home) Advice,"Just  read an article about water getting shut off to some Texas cities.  I  know a lot of you know what you're doing, but here is some quick advice  from a northerner (Washington State.  Not Seattle, but the real  Washington State):

If your pipes  freeze (requires about 20 degrees or so) in copper, steel, or plastic  lines, they will burst. Water will run all over the place.  You should  hear it, see the wet spot somewhere on a wall or floor.  Shut the main  valve off to the house!  There is usually another shut off somewhere out  by the street where the main line ties into your house line.  If you  know where it is (also requires a long tool) then shut it off as well.  I  know here in WA the fire department will help you shut off the main in  the street.  I don't believe that they assist with the main inside the  house.

There is also the  possibility that your pipes have already frozen, but there is no water  leaking, because it's ... well ... frozen.   When it thaws out, you will  then see the water.  Again, shut off the main immediately.

If  you have running water, you can leave it trickling ... like the minimum  water running down the sink to see a stream, but not full blast.  Just a  trickle.  This will prevent pipes from freezing.

If  your water has been SHUT OFF by the water company:  Turn your main  water valve off.  Then go around and open up all your facets. This will  drain almost all the lines in your house.   There is still a little  left, especially in the basement or lowest point of the house.  Leave  the faucets wide open, with the main off.  When water is restored, you  can turn off all faucets, and slowly open the main valve.  You will hear  &amp; feel water flowing at the valve.  It should sound and feed like  it's running for a little bit, but be cautious.  If it keeps ""running""  by the sound and feel of it... you've either forgot to close a faucet in  the house, or there is a broken line... in which case you should turn  the main valve back off and investigate.

I  don't know if this is overkill or not, but I have seen a lot of posts  about water and freezing lines.  Most of us up here know how to prep for  this, however a few minutes of my time could save someone out there a  lot of money in destruction of their property due to water damage.  Just  thought it may help someone out there.

Advice tips and pointers for Texans,"I would like to collect survival tips for those in Texas in one big post for those going through the deep freeze can reference. But first, my preface on the situation for those unaware.

Hopefully the moderators will see this and maybe pin it. For those un aware Texas is going through a deep freeze right now. Tonight's low in Dallas is 18° F. I live in the North East and at night right now its 25°. 

Initially people have laughed at this because they seem to be panicking over an inch of snow. However it is not a joke. They are unprepared for this. They do not have supplies to tackle ice on the roads, no adequate insulation in their homes causing pipes to burts and massive damage ensues. 

People are trying to survive for real, those who never thought they would. The young and elderly alike. In doing this mistakes have been made that we would consider ""stupid"" but can easily be overlooked by a weary, scared and inexperienced individual. There have been 20+ fatalities already.

So below please post your information below. If someone is wrong kindly correct them. Let's try to keep this clean and organized, so no petty arguments please. Correcting a mistake that could kill someone is obviously encouraged.

_______________________________________________________
Don't heat your house with a gas range stove. Not only does it emit CO but it also consumes oxygen and after a long period of time will leave you with very little.

Bundle up your clothes in layers so you can take off some if its too warm. You extremities are prone to frostbite so don't forget to put on an extra pair of socks, and socks on your hands of you dont have gloves.

Don't forget your vehicle so you can survive god forbid it breaks down. Carry a lighter, matches etc, blankets extra clothes flashlights.

Filling the Bathtub is a great idea. Do you still have running water? Remember the water in the tank (not bowl) of the toilet is clean!

Wax wood versus fat wood.,"Since I suck at getting fatwood I thought I'd give making was wood a shot.

Figuring the wax wouldn't soak in very far I cut some 6"" x 2.75"" 2.75"" pieces of pine. That's also a decent size to put in my tinder pouch too.

I grabbed the crock pot I use for wax and filled it up with old candles and got it melted. I popped the wood in the pot and weighted it to keep it under the surface. After about 8 hours I pulled the wood out and cooled it down on some plastic.

To test it out I split it lengthwise in 4 pieces so I could shave some from the very center of the wood where I assumed no was would have gotten to. Well I was wrong. The wood in the center was shiny and shaved up similar to fatwood. 

After I had a little pile I grabbed my ferrorod and gave it a try. It took a little bit more effort to get it to catch some sparks but it caught and started burning quite nicely. It was a smooth flame unlike fatwood that normally sputters and spits. It was not as vigorous as fatwood but seemed to burn about as long.

So overall wax wood is a pretty good replacement for natural fatwood.  Anyone else ever try it out?",0,1613700238,yer_muther,11,1,True,2021-02-18,"wax wood versus fat wood. since i suck at getting fatwood i thought i'd give making was wood a shot.

i grabbed the crock pot i use for wax and filled it up with old candles and got it melted. i popped the wood in the pot and weighted it to keep it under the surface. after about 8 hours i pulled the wood out and cooled it down on some plastic.

to test it out i split it lengthwise in 4 pieces so i could shave some from the very center of the wood where i assumed no was would have gotten to. well i was wrong. the wood in the center was shiny and shaved up similar to fatwood. 

after i had a little pile i grabbed my ferrorod and gave it a try. it took a little bit more effort to get it to catch some sparks but it caught and started burning quite nicely. it was a smooth flame unlike fatwood that normally sputters and spits. it was not as vigorous as fatwood but seemed to burn about as long.

so overall wax wood is a pretty good replacement for natural fatwood.  anyone else ever try it out?"
How many times should I boil water?,"I'm currently facing a water shortage due to the winter storm in Texas. My pipes were shut off today as well. In terms of drinking water, I have plenty to last me maybe 5 days. But I have none for dishes and hygiene. 

There's a creek right next to my apartment and I went ahead and scooped a few buckets of that. After boiling it for 10 minutes and letting it sit it's still a murky grey color. Clay has also been spotted on the side of my pot. For now I'm planning on boiling it twice and then filtering it through a brita filter. (Sorry if that breaks the Urban survival rule).

Regarding boiling water to make it drinkable,"The point of boiling water is to pasteurize it, to kill microbes (viruses, bacteria, etc).  Pasteurization requires a temperature of 170 degrees F.

Bringing your water to a rolling boil accomplishes that.

If there are floaties in your water, you may need to boil longer (this is where all the arbitrary numbers like “boil your water for 10 minutes” come from).

Boiling water does not remove chemical or heavy metal contamination.

If you have clean looking and smelling water, filter it as best you can (such as with a clean t-shirt, coffee filter), then boil it.

If your water has a lot of sediment, filter it, let it settle, draw off the clearest water, repeat as needed, then boil.

If you have some sort of household filter like a brita pitcher, use it last.  You don’t want to contaminate it with microbes, and you don’t want to clog it.",0,1613712169,Akski,118,1,True,2021-02-19,"regarding boiling water to make it drinkable the point of boiling water is to pasteurize it, to kill microbes (viruses, bacteria, etc).  pasteurization requires a temperature of 170 degrees f.

"Hardcore survival expert here. Literally been around the world, done a lot. AMA.","Several people, due to this sub, messaged me asking me questions. 

Backstory: I grew up in the 70s and 80s in a Mormon household, up in high mountains. in a place that got 10+ feet of snow per year. When I was 20, I scored a job in the Sheriff's Dept., and then, three years later, I left that and became a freelance journalist, with a focus on survival. This led to a 15 year career, travelling the globe, doing stories about survival. 

In that time, I was sent all over the place. Belize, Afghanistan, Thailand, Costa Rica, Iceland, to name a few. There was one year where I literally paid rent on an apartment in Colorado, and only spent two weekends in it, because I was being sent to other places. After 15 years of it, I got tired. 

Now I'm almost 50, living in the suburbs of Dallas, and enjoying civilization. That said, I also spend most weekends out in the woods, getting away from creature comforts. I'm an avid survivalist, to this day, and roughing it is still a fun time for me. But I still know how to get water from nothing, how to find medicine from plants, and how to start a fire in the worst snowstorm. I've hiked through the Mojave and the Tundra, and had a hard time in the rainforests when a jaguar literally tried to kill everyone in my party. These days, I mostly work in IT part time (computers have always been a thing of mine), and as a bouncer at bars. It's a good life. 

I do want to maintain my anonymous status on Reddit. Someone certainly might be able to use this post to figure out who I am... I ask that you not. If you do, groovy, but please keep it to yourself.

Survival Book Club: How to get together to talk about survival books.,"So my last two posts about the survival books seemed to have been mostly missed by everyone on here, I know timing is a thing. 27 people joined the discord, but we've never had a group conversation. So I am starting to think of creating a new subreddit for a survival book club, and I may do it anyway, but wanted to try and post this on here and see if there is any preference on here on what we should do.

I know how to moderate a subreddit, I created r/thesilmarillion and did a successful read-along of *The Silmarillion.* Having our own subreddit is kind of the point of Reddit I guess. We could still post on here, maybe post reviews or something, to still contribute to the survival community.

Great stuff to add to your first aid kits at home or in the bag,So I used to suffer from a Pilonidal Cyst and if anyone knows what that is it can sometimes be impossible to heal. At one point in my life I went in for surgery to get it removed and went through an open wound healing process that was torture to say the least. Well it of course did not work and the cyst returned instantly. I had given up on trying different things especially what the Drs were recommending. Started to look into more natural Pathic stuff. Long story shot I gave an item a try that was recommended. It is a colloidal silver and aloe gel. Needless to say we use it for everything now around the house from cuts and scrapes to teenager acne and it does wonders. Anyway thought I would share. Name of the type I used is literally colloidal silver gel and it comes in a dark blue container with a white lid and label. There are other variants out there this is just the one I used. Feel free to share of any you may have tried.

Squirrel Cleaning,"Mu cousin killed a couple of squirrels today and dropped them off for me. My wife and kids love wild game. My boys have only ever seen me clean a squirrel twice before since I mostly do it in the woods.

I also showed them the ""undress"" method which severs the tail and pulls the skin off tail to head in one smooth pull (typically).

Finding Water,"3 Minutes without air

3 Hours without adequate heat

**3 Days without potable water**

3 weeks without food

- Follow the animal tracks.  They might lead you to water

- Swarms of insects indicate that a source of water may be nearby

- Bird flight paths at dawn and sunset may indicate a source of water

- Listen carefully -- running water may be heard from some distance away

- In muddy areas, you might try digging a hole 18"" deep.  If it fills, the groundwater will need to be filtered and then boiled.

- DO NOT DRINK

- Blood

- Urine

- Sea Ice

- Unmelted Ice

- Alcohol (*)

- Fish Juices

- Rainwater in most rural areas can usually be consumed without risk of disease or illness. If it rains, use any and all containers you can get your hands on to collect it. If you have a poncho or can find some plastic sheeting, spread it out and tie the corners to trees a few feet off the ground. Find a container and tie the poncho on a slant with a slight sag to allow the rain to collect and drain. If you can't find a container, tie it level on all four corners and give it even more of a sag -- it will serve as a makeshift water bag. If the rainwater tastes a little different, it's because it lacks certain minerals that are found in groundwater or streams.


To make a water filtration device...

- Find a large can, hollow log or plastic bag. Hollow bamboo will also work.
- Punch 5-10 small holes around the base of your container and suspend it from the ground.
- Fill it with alternating layers of rock, sand and cloth.
- Use both fine and coarse layers, the more the better.
- Pour your collected water into the filter and catch it in another container below.

The best overall method to produce potable water is to boil it.

There are methods of gathering water from leaves, and it is also possible to create a still.  However, these, are ""last resorts"" -- it is better to search diligently and find a source on non-brackish water, filter and boil it and hydrate.",0,1613238191,Touristupdatenola,6,1,True,2021-02-13,"finding water 3 minutes without air

Less Stroud's website [lesstroud.ca](https://www.lesstroud.ca/). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why this book?** In our last book, we learned what most people do in disaster situations. The three phases: denial that anything is wrong, deliberation on options considered, and decisions on what (and what not) to do. How we react in the few first seconds or minutes can mean life and death in many circumstances. So what happens after you make it out of the airplane crash or another disaster? How do you survive? 

In his book, *Survive!,* Less Stroud teaches critical survival skills for the days or weeks after you survive. At first, I had my doubts. Is this just a book to promote a tv show? There is no doubting his own survival skills, but that doesn't always mean the person with those skills will be a good teacher. Luckily, in his book, Less Stroud does an amazing job of explaining his skills so anyone can grasp the fundamentals of the lesson. The skills must be practiced and, in some cases, taught, but the teaching is sound and, I believe, accessible to anyone who wants to learn how to Survive!

From the sun-scorched sands of the Kalahari to the snake-infested jungles of the Amazon, Les Stroud has made a life of surviving in the harshest—and most remote—regions on Earth.

Now, the creator, producer, and host of the hit television program *Survivorman* transfers his decades of knowledge and experience to the pages of *Survive!*, a practical guide that gives everyday readers a no-nonsense look at the real world of survival.

Stroud offers readers the essential skills and tactics necessary to endure in any corner of the globe, along with a wealth of insider information born of his own experiences in the outdoors and unavailable in any other book. Readers will learn:

* How to make a survival shelter and why a lean-to is largely a waste of time.
* Why survival kits are important, and why you should make your own.
* Where to find water and why drinking contaminated water is sometimes warranted.
* How to locate and trap small animals and why the notion of tracking and hunting large game is largely a pipe dream.

Whether seasoned in the outdoor arts or new to adventuring, all readers will learn something from *Survive!*. Stroud's many colorful anecdotes and cut-to-the-chase philosophy not only make for an entertaining read but also enhance anyone's ability to focus on the main goal when everything else has gone wrong—survival.

**why this book?** in our last book, we learned what most people do in disaster situations. the three phases: denial that anything is wrong, deliberation on options considered, and decisions on what (and what not) to do. how we react in the few first seconds or minutes can mean life and death in many circumstances. so what happens after you make it out of the airplane crash or another disaster? how do you survive?

Don't buy Columbia gear - terrible customer service,"I want to share my experience with Columbia.

Why using moss for navigation is risky.,"Recently I was in a heated discussion about using moss for navigation as someone was in strong support of this despite much evidence showing moss can grow in direct sunlight and on all sides of tress and limbs in many areas of the country. I can personally attest to that in many areas myself.
     The discussion started out as what were various methods of navigating. A compass will always point to magnetic North unless interfered with by something local that is magnetic or magnet attracting. The shadow line with sticks and sun method is also pretty accurate. The North Star is very accurate, fortunately, for night time navigation as well. However, using moss on a tree is just not reliable enough in general other than in a vague way, and many times, not useful at all. 
   When navigating over a decent distance, being off by a few degrees can make travel far more difficult and far less accurate. Moss can grow in direct sunlight. Moss can grow on all sides of trees. Moss wants to grow where conditions are best, and if there is moisture and less sunlight, they might prefer that, but there are over 22,000 varieties of moss and many will grow in direct sunlight.
   If you simply Google or use another search engine for mossy trees in various states, you will very easily find many photos of trees with moss in direct sunlight and on all sides of trees, leading to an inability to navigate by the Moss Only Grows on the North Side of Trees method well at all. 
   Our subreddit here is about sharing and learning new and old skills, talking about good gear and bad, how too's, opinions, and more. i also believe an important facet of this is debunking bad ideas and myths that have been shown to be untrue or marginally true or risky in nature if depending on them could be a matter of life or death. After all, it's called Survival. 
   Again, it's easy to disprove the moss myth with a simple search for mossy trees in sunlight or just mossy trees or moss in sunlight. If there are local areas a person is familiar with where moss only grows directly on the North side and not on any other side, this could be useful but as a loose rule, it could also be a dangerous method that leads people far away from their hoped for direction all on it's own.  There simply are far more accurate, safe, and simple methods for travel and.... survival.

SAFE Mushrooms to Forage in PNW?,"Hello guys!

Sharpening knives with wetstones - any helpful videos?,"Hey guys. I've been sharpening my own knives for years. I've never been *great* at it but I can at least hone them down and get a cutting edge on them. In all honesty, I've been just using something like this for the last 10 years:

I tried using it based on my readings and some quick little youtube videos online. The end result was depressing - wasn't any sharper than what I've had before. Couldn't cut through paper well, couldn't cut through the hair on my arm.

The videos I find are mostly chef videos it seems so I'm not sure if the concepts are the same. Also, they all record the videos facing them, and as silly as it sounds, it's hard for me to mimic what theyre doing - I'd like a video from their perspective, looking down so I can actually copy what theyre doing.

Packing light vs packing more than enough (redundancy),"There’s a large portion of survivalist minded folks who like to pack extremely light. And it does make sense because calories are an important commodity not to be wasted in a survival situation.

There’s also a crowd among us who will pack everything including the kitchen sink (to embellish a bit). And that strategy has its benefits as well.

Personally I like to find a happy medium between the 2. Especially with food. I prefer to have more food than I need in my INCH bag. You just have no idea what’s ahead, so for me, that extra food is a feeling of added security for my well-being. 

Everyone has a different viewpoint about how a survival situation would be upon them. For me, I spend a lot of time in the remote wilderness exploring. So I carry enough gear that I could take 2 weeks on foot to make it home if need be. I could cover 10km a day comfortably. But if I had a broken bone, it’s going to be considerably less than that. So I plan accordingly. 

Although I pack heavy, I can always eliminate things. But without it in the first place, you have what you have.

What kind of calories are in your B.O.B.?,"As I learn and add and change my contents of my BOB, food and calories has become one of my biggest questions.

How to tell if water is safe to swim in?,"Probably obvious... I know plenty of discussions on how to determine water safety for drinking, but what if I'm just going to be swimming around? I see nice-looking little creeks on hikes and wonder if I'd get a brain-eating amoeba by taking a dip.

A missing teen snowmobiler built a snow cave to survive until rescuers arrived

After going missing while on a snowmobile, a Canadian teenager managed to survive by building a snow cave to stay in until he was found.

A 17-year-old in British Columbia, who has not been named, built himself a snow cave the backcountry to shelter in after being separated from his group, according to South Cariboo Search and Rescue.At around 6:15 pm on Saturday, 100 Mile House Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was notified of an overdue snowmobiler.Family and friends of the teen had returned to a parking lot, but he had never showed, according to a news release from RCMP.Some of the party remained on the hill and began searching, while others left to alert South Cariboo Search and Rescue, who contacted 100 Mile House RCMP. South Cariboo SAR eventually located the teenager, finding him ""in good condition,"" RCMP said in its release.""This young man did everything right after things went wrong,"" SAR wrote [in a Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/SouthCaribooSAR/posts/3736946836351632) praising the teen. ""He got separated from his group and after multiple failed attempts to get back out of the area, the way he got into it and not knowing the terrain and area, he parked his sled in a wide-open area, walked over to a nearby treed area and built himself an incredible snow cave to spend the night.""

The post continued, ""When our team members came across him, he was in the shelter with food and water. This young man made our task a little less difficult by staying in place and having some backcountry winter survival knowledge.""

The 100 Mile House RCMP thanked the South Cariboo SAR team for bringing the search to another positive outcome.

Jon Krakauer Advices to Go Big but Have a Plan,"Chris McCandless is the poster child for “Reject modernity: Embrace monke”. Jon Krakauer is the author you would want to investigate your adventurous death as done in bestseller, *Into the Wild*. A young educated ideologue donated his savings, burnt his cash and began a journey hitchhiking across the United States. He Tom Sawyered down the Colorado River into Mexico and worked on communal farms in South Dakota. Mother nature became his only tolerable companion eventually luring him into the Alaskan Bush. The original Nature boy, Henry David Thoreau said it best and Krakeur writes from his identical personal experience as a young man, “It appears to be a law that you cannot have a deep sympathy with both man and nature”. This story analyzes the mentality behind a nomadic being, are they explorers in the wrong age, pilgrims without religion or brutish societally inapt apes? The choice is yours. Harambe once said, “Humans claim to value autonomy but when given the chance to break free from the chains of industrial society… they refuse. Curious.”

Need suggestions on a new Gear Belt,"To those of you with tactical gear belts, what brands/models do you swear by? Which do you avoid? My current gear belt does what it needs to do, but it has metal clips that hold the excess length of belt in place, and it becomes uncomfortable when I'm walking at length.

I'm looking for something 1.5 to 2 inches wide and is comfortable to wear for long stretches. Ideally I'd like to find one where the excess belt length folds back along the inside of the worn belt and velcros to itself, rather than any kind of belt that uses metal clips. Padding isn't necessary because it seems to get in the way of attaching clip holders/multi-tool/flashlight etc, but let me know if I'm wrong in that assumpyion.

One critical feature would be the buckle. I'm not opposed to molded plastic as long as you can attest to it holding up for you in the field.

I got lost in the woods when I was 11. This is what I did.,"Alright so I’m not sure if there is a better sub to put this on, but I’ll just share the story of how I got lost in the woods and found my way out when I was 11 years old. 

This happened in 2015. My grandparents and some other family live in a suburb of Denver CO (not where the story takes place) and every August, my family drives 15 hours to visit them for about 2 weeks. My grandparents also own a house in Winter Park, which is mostly known for its skiing, but also has a lot of other things to do, so that is where we usually spend most of our time in Colorado. My cousins also live there, and this will be important.

One of my cousins, who I’ll call Max (fake name don’t worry) is about 4 months older then me. On this particular day, he had found a big rock that he wanted to show me. So Max and I walk into some woods. We don’t go too deep so I am not worried. The rock isn’t all that Max had said told me it was, and I get bored and go back to the house by myself. 

I actually had gone the completely wrong way, and I end up at a small creek after about 2 minutes of walking. I can see a road that looks somewhat familiar to me on the other side, so I  try to cross it. However, the water is too cold, and is moving too fast for me to cross. I walk along the creek, hoping to find some rocks or a log that I could use to get across. I can not find either, and I eventually end up in a muddy ditch. 

After climbing out of the ditch, I notice that I am now on a dirt path. I start walking, and hope that the path will lead me to a road. It doesn’t. It leads me to a hill, that for me was quite steep. I start to climb the hill which was probably about 30-40 feet. I get to the top hoping to get a better overview of my surroundings. My heart sinks as I see more trees. I do however see a light, and I start walking to it because I assume it is some kind of clearing. My plan is that I would be able to see a ski lift and know what general direction to go. However, it is not the clearing that I thought it was. It was the highway.

After I look across the highway, I see a sign that says Winter Park is in 1 mile. I walk the one mile along the highway, and just after I take the normal turn off the highway, I see my grandma’s car coming my way to look for me. She picks me up, and that is pretty much the end.",0,1610345847,njmcdermott04,10,1,True,2021-01-11,"i got lost in the woods when i was 11. this is what i did. alright so i’m not sure if there is a better sub to put this on, but i’ll just share the story of how i got lost in the woods and found my way out when i was 11 years old.

More on the wool vs synthetic choice.,"I had a very interesting online convo with a chemist recently, about why wool is typically less smelly to wear than most synthetics. I knew that wool is oleophobic, resists oils, and he explained that the molecules of body oils which become smelly as they turn rancid are actually repelled by the molecules of the wool fibres, because of their electrical charge. Oils are non-polar molecules whereas water and wool are polar molecules, and the two types can’t mix. So wool is effectively non-stick as far as body oils go. As wool fibres rub together the molecules of oils are broken down and ‘fall off’. 
Polyester is made from oil and absorbs oils very well, so our body oils build up, turn rancid and smell bad. 
Now, as we know, wool holds a lot of water and takes ages to dry, and if it’s wet enough it’s not warm, despite what you might hear from advertisers. No fabric that has its air pockets filled with water can be as warm as a dry fabric. But another study I heard about suggests that even a 20% wool content in fibre gives clothing the same anti odour effect as pure wool, so we can have the benefits of fast drying synthetics with the wearability of wool. 
I’d like to hear please from anyone out there who has wool/synthetic mix clothing right now, whether it’s a jumper, long johns, t shirt, etc, who can give their impression of its odiferousness after a long time wearing it. What’s the ratio of wool to synthetic, and also how fast does it dry?

What are people’s thoughts on how you should physically prepare yourself for survival/ wilderness?

I don’t think body fat percentage is what is important here, but it would seem that the ability to move long distances with a heavy load as well as having some skills like skiing, climbing or swimming could be your best bet for self rescue.

Kerosene Heaters,"I have two kerosene heaters I am cleaning up in preparation for winter.  One is an old Perfection model and the other is a larger Corona model.

Medical kit posts rant,"Alright, I’m getting annoyed and slightly worried with some of the posts I’ve seen here about first aid kits. The amount of people that have done a day-long first aid course and are packing a huge first aid kit they have no idea how to use is downright dangerous.

I’m trained as a level 3 first responder with an additional Medicine in Remote Areas training course under my belt here in the UK, so I’m pretty low on the medical ladder, but I know more than the average person.

A rubber tourniquet for gaining IV access is NOT suitable for stopping a catastrophic bleed. You’re gonna be up shit creek without a paddle if you’ve got an arterial bleed going on and that’s the only bleeding control method you have.

An Israeli bandage is not a substitute for a tourniquet, they both stop bleeding in different ways, and an Israeli bandage is only suitable for stopping major bleeds. Don’t buy them to use on a nasty looking graze.

A little pair of £0.99 scissors will not shear through layers of clothing, medical shears will.

There’s no shame in having a small first aid kit if you have no/minimal training. There’s no point wasting money on pieces of kit that you’d have to find a YouTube tutorial to figure out how to use, and no one is expecting you to carry out a chest needle decompression if you don’t have training to back it up.

Only operate within your scope of practice, anything past that and you could be damaging the casualty more than benefiting them.

Survival Book Reading Club; I am thinking about getting a group together to read survival books and discussing them.,"Hello r/survival, I am a bit of a survival nerd and would like to start reading through some survival books, and as good survival doesn't happen in a vacuum,  I would like to see if anyone here would be interested in joining me. I plan to keep the group relatively small at first and plan on having most spots for people who can commit to being ""full-timers"" and have some spots for ""part-timers"" or people who are only interested in specific books.

As for what book the group goes over, I already have a pretty long list made, but I would also put such things up to a vote. Most would be survival-related, but some would also be prepper related and real-life survival accounts, and pretty much no fiction books, but I am open to discussing anything.

Below are some of the books I was thinking about going over. The list is in order of length, not the order I would read them in. If anyone has any books they would like to recommend that the group or I read, I would really appreciate those in the comment below.

Looking for a backpack thats durable with a few key features,"Full disclosure, this will be a bag that spends most of its time in my vehicle. Seldom do I see an appropriate time to have a backpack while out and about. Hiking, thats a different story.

I like the slimmer pocket directly behind the back pad. Then a big pocket to store everything else. Like my small(er) med kit. Some clothes and/or jacket. 

Also a sternum strap.

History of Bushcraft in Northern Europe,"Hello.

Calories,"We all know that calories are essential to keep going in a longer term survival scenario, and gathering is typically much more reliable than hunting, but often the emphasis is put on gathering the wrong things. It depends what’s available of course but for example, cattail root is a classic survival food but has only 25 calories per 100g, the same as most fish, whereas fresh nettles have 45 per 100g, almost twice as much, mostly as carbs, with some fats, and also contain protein. Worms have less than 1 calorie each, so good for bait but the effort of digging them up to actually eat will burn more than they give back. 
Hawthorn berries have approx 140 cals per 100g.
When sacrificing emergency rations to use as bait it’s important to weigh up the trade off too; peanut butter has 30 cals per 5g spoonful, whereas a squirrel has 200 cals on average, which is a good trade, as long as you don’t waste more than say, 2 spoons to catch one, factoring in the extra energy used in hunting/setting a trap, walking to and fro, skinning etc. Otherwise it would be better to simply eat it yourself and stay still.",0,1608896637,carlbernsen,17,1,True,2020-12-25,"calories we all know that calories are essential to keep going in a longer term survival scenario, and gathering is typically much more reliable than hunting, but often the emphasis is put on gathering the wrong things. it depends what’s available of course but for example, cattail root is a classic survival food but has only 25 calories per 100g, the same as most fish, whereas fresh nettles have 45 per 100g, almost twice as much, mostly as carbs, with some fats, and also contain protein. worms have less than 1 calorie each, so good for bait but the effort of digging them up to actually eat will burn more than they give back.

"Not into survival per se, but could use your (r/survival) expertise on layering for cold weather work","I'm a first responder and work night shift. About 2/3 of my shift I'm in a warm vehicle or office, the other 1/3 I'm on my feet outside where it is getting pretty dang cold. Sometimes I'm standing around, other times I'm walking around or on standing idly on foot. Sometimes running ( but not that often). 

&amp;#x200B;

At first I just wanted to buy a nice jacket but now realize that I am *much* better off with wearing some layers such as merino wool. Did some searching and seems like merino wool is very common amongst those who spend a lot of time in the outdoors and are into bushcraft/survival/hunting.

So here's my situation, hoping to get some help as I'm sure this will help others in this community:

&amp;#x200B;

I have to wear body armor and I wear it in a vest *outside* on my uniform. I can't wear a jacket over this vest, and underneath the armor I can't wear anything too thick. catch 22 I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I work 4 days a week for at least 10 hours each day, sometimes longer. I'm hoping to invest some money in a few articles of clothing that won't break the bank but will do it's job. I was thinking of some merino wool base layers with a fleece layer on top. I already bought a lite shell jacket (called a condor summit zero). Have not tried the jacket yet but seems like it will stop wind and give some warmth.

My goal is to invest in a few identical layers for each day of work that I can just wash at the end of the week. I get really stinky at work because of all my gear so buying a super expensive set of warming clothes and wearing them everyday is not practical.

"Planning on hiking part of the AT next year, trying to find the last few items. Help?","So I was thinking, I have an old but otherwise undamaged Kelty Mistrial 20 (for women, cuz I'm a woman) and it's a little flat, so maybe it would be a good idea to add a liner to my current sleeping setup if it gets to temperatures that require it. I don't know how to find out which liner to buy for my bag, and when I look for branded ones I don't see them. Having not enough or too much material/length just sounds like a bad time to me. 

I also would love your guys' advice for a solid (but light) cooking pot that I can just plop onto my fire (or grate) and not worry about its integrity for cooking. Honestly, I'm probably going to pack in freeze-dry for the majority of my calories. I'm not confident in my IDs enough to risk a bad berry.  Probably also going to boil water, etc, with the pot.

i also would love your guys' advice for a solid (but light) cooking pot that i can just plop onto my fire (or grate) and not worry about its integrity for cooking. honestly, i'm probably going to pack in freeze-dry for the majority of my calories. i'm not confident in my ids enough to risk a bad berry.  probably also going to boil water, etc, with the pot. ideally with a hole at the end of the handle i can use to clip it to my pack frame.

Sleeping on top of a Dakota Firehole is actually a really good way to stay warm through the night.,"I recently went out on a primitive camping trip where I knew the temps were going to be below freezing at night. I had little more than a wool blanket for bedding, so I decided to try an idea I've been contemplating for a long time, but have never seen anybody else use--and which worked amazingly well.

I absolutely love Dakota fireholes for camping. They're low-impact, incredibly fuel-efficient, produce little smoke, are much safer than an open fire in dry conditions, and are great for cooking over. But after a trip to Japan last year, I wondered if they could be used in another way, similar to a traditional kotatsu.

A [kotatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu) is a piece of furniture that combines a low table with a warm, insulative skirt--think a coffee table with a blanket for a table cloth. These days they use an electric heater set into the underside of the table, but before electric heating was an option they used a small metal pit set into the floor under the table filled with burning charcoal.

This seems like an idea with some drawbacks indoors, namely carbon monoxide and fire hazard, but it got me thinking about its usefulness when camping--could you just sleep on top of a Dakota firehole that had burned down to coals?

So on this last trip, after digging [my firehole and kindling a fire](https://preview.redd.it/7h03n9i240461.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3f2c53668b84228350e105c9f455aa1e720b6ed), I burned as much hardwood as I could over the course of a few hours before dark. This produced a nice bed of coals at the bottom of the pit,  about 6"" (15cm) deep in my 8""-ish (20cm) wide hole. That may not seem like much for hours of burning, but remember that this is a very small, efficient fire.

Come nightfall, I just...lay down on top of that bad boy, with the hole directly between my thighs and a wool blanket over the top of me.

It worked GREAT. I was warm all night, sleeping in the open in sub-freezing temperatures.  It was downright hot at first, but as the coals were blanketed with ash, they cooled from lack of airflow, and I was able to close my legs over the hole without burning the backs of my thighs. Eventually, the ash got thick enough that heat production slowed down and I started feeling chilly. I sat up, stirred the hole with a stick to bring fresh coals to the fresh air at the surface, and the cycle repeated. I had to stir the hole about once every 3 hours, an operation which took 30 seconds, max, and unlike rekindling or even just stoking a fire it took no finesse or concentration. I barely had to wake up to do it.

That plume of heat coming up directly between your femoral arteries keeps your feet in particular nice and toasty.

A few caveats: Obviously, the fire should be burned down to coals, but even so this is best done with a wool blanket if possible, since nylon or polyester are very, very bad news when they catch fire or even just melt. Also, don't stick your head under the blanket or do this in an enclosed shelter--carbon monoxide is a real risk.

Some folks have suggested digging a long pit, building a fire in it, burying it come nightfall and sleeping over that--but that would require excavating several dozen times as much dirt as digging a firehole, building a much bigger fire, moving all that dirt *again* to re-bury it, and would only be good for a single night--you'd have to re-dig it all over again the next day.  The firehole, conversely, is extremely re-useable.

Other folks have suggested just sleeping with a hot water bottle, but as high as the specific heat capacity of water is, you'd need about 45 liters/12 gallons of boiling-temp water to give off the same amount of heat as the small volume of charcoal I had in the bottom of my pit.

Future avenues of research could be figuring out how to make this work with a raised bed platform, since the cold ground is the biggest source of heat loss with this technique. I laid down a pallet of rushes as an attempt at some small insulation, but with little success.

Belt Rigs: What’s the advantages?,"I’ve slowly seen, at least on my side, more and more belt rigs either being advertised and/or used and they look good and like they’d be able to condense my usual kit but I feel I’m missing something.

Surely if you have a rucksack that has a waist support strap then that’s more beneficial as you have more storage space while weight being evenly distributed across your back. Plus as well they make rucksack rain covers but I’m yet to see one for the belt rigs. 
Personally, I feel it’s more down to looks as a big bulky waistline with a small amount of webbing up top just doesn’t do it for me as much but practicality obviously beats aesthetic in my eyes. 

I guess I’m just wanting someone that genuinely sees a benefit to using them for light travel and 1 nighters as a better option than just a ‘day-bag’ size rucksack as I’m sat on the fence as to whether I should invest in one or whether they’re a waste of time.",0,1608129394,H-R-R-,58,1,True,2020-12-16,"belt rigs: what’s the advantages? i’ve slowly seen, at least on my side, more and more belt rigs either being advertised and/or used and they look good and like they’d be able to condense my usual kit but i feel i’m missing something.

I went on a motorbike trip with 2 friends and fell ill at the side of the road, 1000+ miles from home, 400 miles to the nearest hospital. Single lanes, little overtaking opportunity even for emergency vehicles; it's too unsafe. 

This made me realise how underwhelmed we were prepared for an emergency.

I was that bad, they were trying to figure out how to get my stuff home and then airlift me to hospital. 

I then tried to ride home, made it 50 miles and crashed into a river from blacking out. I was worse than I thought.

6 locals dragged my motorbike out, and it made me sink in how screwed I really was when the locals said ""have you got signal?"" - I neglected to even think about this.

Recovery quoted me £1500 due to my fault; I managed to get the bike working after a while.

In the end, I recovered enough to ride 250 miles to a camp site for the night, making my way home.

I know why I fell ill, and I trusted my friend who repeatedly agreed to take my medical needs into the trip schedule... He didn't. 

I plan to do the very same trip on my own next year , under my own steam. This does carry risks, i.e being on my own.

I know my body, and it was all preventable had he taken my needs into account. 

I tried repeatedly to say I'm doing this on my own, but pressured me to carry on - all camp sites had been pre booked and paid.

This is new territory for us but we are excited at the prospects. With more than 1.1 million members and several moderators who are professional survival instructors with good connections, r/survival is positioned to be the most powerful survival/bushcraft social media influencer in the world.

The problem to date has been that most well known bushcraft personalities are field guys who don't know much about tech and have their social media accounts managed by assistants who opt for sexier platforms such as Instagram. Worse yet, there are many survivalists who are much more skilled than the well known guys, but have no social media presence whatsoever. We are working to have some of both types to have some AMAs, and have a couple reality TV stars lined up for early next year.

We feel that Reddit is a far better platform for these individuals because it is set up for people to have in depth conversations with each other. Also, with Reddit's changes to it's TOS in the last couple years improving the site by implementing official policies against bigotry and propaganda Reddit is losing the stigma it used to have.

We are working to make r/survival the go-to place for conversations with high level experts in the relevant fields.

We are looking for people from a wide variety of backgrounds: primitive skills, military/tactical, search and rescue, experimental archeology, and much more. We hope to get people from all over the world, men and women, from as many cultures as possible, to give people a chance to learn from experts they would not normally be aware of, and to give those experts a chance to reach new audiences.

But, we would very much like your help.

"Hey, I need some tips for a backpacking manual in writing","Hello, The other day I began a writing project consisting of 11 chapters Prayers and meditations, Edible plants, Songs, Bushcraft, Stories, Hunting and Trapping, Recipes, First Aid, Emergency services, Packing , and Journal and notes which will just be blank. Keep in mind this book is just going to be for me , I don’t plan to sell it since I have very little experience in the wilderness and wouldn’t want to be responsible for other peoples deaths.

I completed chapter 1 “Prayers and Mediations” yesterday, which is an essential chapter to add for me since Im Catholic. The chapter is 71 pages long and covers all the essential prayers, a full guide to the rosary, and the first few chapters of genesis just for fun.

ALRIGHT, now this is the part I need help with. Chapter 2 is going to cover edible plants. This is very risky territory especially for someone with as little experience as me.

The first part of chapter 2 will be covering edible plants in North America. Iv already written about the 2 most easily identifiable edible plants, clover and dandelion. However things got tricky when I moved on to evergreen trees, which is surprisingly difficult to research.

My question is

In North America, are there any evergreen trees that are toxic/poisonous? Is it safe to eat the inner bark, nuts, and sap of all pine/fir sub species? And how can I best identify the ones that are safe to eat?

Also

Do you know of any other plants that are easily identifiable and edible? Also what plants should be avoided at all costs?

Regarding weapons...,"I'm no survival expert, far from it. No experience in the wilderness/hunting/anything else. Regardless, one thought I still haven't been able to answer is what weapon would I want in a survival scenario (mostly for hunting for food and such, less of a ""defend against humans"" weapon) I've put up many options:

1 - Knife (?): From what I've read, knives are an essential tool for survivability (makes sense, you can use it to cut material, skin animals you catch and prepare them properly, etc). But for actual use for hunting I cant see them being useful in the act? unless you wear the animal out or set up a trap and then are able to put the animal to rest quickly with it it doesn't seem optimal.

2 - Sword: Longer knife, cool. Could also help fend off against threats, human or not. (in my mind at least). But the actual making of it would probably end up flimsy and unstable? compared to a knife it needs much more to hold it together due to the increased size (unless you go for something machete-like, which might be more reasonable).

3 - Gun: here's where I think a lot, multiple articles and users on various sites and forums have always recommended guns as survival weapons (no shit, you can basically kill anything if you got the distance and the aim) but how am I supposed to get ammo for them? If we don't count the material finding and creation for the weapon (aka lets say I already own a gun and have it on me) Ammo is probably a serious concern. I've seen \*possible\* alternatives like paper cartridges which may be more efficient and accessible but I still don't see it being a constant reliable choice. One thing I haven't delved too deep into is black powder weapons and the possible accessibility of those so feel free to input on these if there is valuable info.

4 - Bow and arrow: this one is kind of the one that convinces me the most, seems like the easiest to make granted you have the tools to acquire and assemble it and the easiest to make ammo (arrows) for.

PotPerm and Glycerin fire-starting ironically doesn't work in the cold.,"Funny observation from a weekend camping trip. I have little vials of glycerin and Potassium Permanganate that I planned on using for starting a fire. If you mix the two on a warm sunny day, you get a fire in a matter of seconds. When I tried it camping, with the ambient air temp probably around 40 degrees F, there was no reaction. After putting about 3 times as much of the ingredients together, and waiting several minutes, I did get ignition. 

In hindsight, it should have been obvious that this would be an issue. The kinetic rate of a chemical reaction always slows with lower temperature, and I'm sure the increased viscosity of glycerin hindered mixing even more. 

So long story short, warm up your ingredients before using them. My glycerin vial is plastic and small enough to put in my mouth (plus glycerin is non-toxic), so in the future, I might just pop it in there for a few minutes to warm it up to 98.6.",0,1606933207,GeorgeCauldron7,18,1,True,2020-12-02,"potperm and glycerin fire-starting ironically doesn't work in the cold. funny observation from a weekend camping trip. i have little vials of glycerin and potassium permanganate that i planned on using for starting a fire. if you mix the two on a warm sunny day, you get a fire in a matter of seconds. when i tried it camping, with the ambient air temp probably around 40 degrees f, there was no reaction. after putting about 3 times as much of the ingredients together, and waiting several minutes, i did get ignition.

"[Motopacking across Mexico] Instructional material of any kind (videos, links, documents, recordings) pertaining to the NOLS Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course","TLDR: Has anyone taken the NOLS Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course and knows of a place where I could gain access to the resources provided by the course? 

\------

Unfortunately, I was unable to take this course in person and I have found myself living very close to the jungles of Central / South America. 

A very dear friend and I have bought motorcycles and are riding slowly southward through Mexico. 

We've spent most of our  time learning about motorcycles with regard to safety, repair, and maintenance mechanics but haven't prepared in similar fashion for living in the bush — though that is to be our main residence eventually (a sort of boss monster challenge, as I see it). We are as yet still very ignorant when it comes to wilderness and safety basics — shelter, injury and poison treatment, etc.)

We have spent the past 11 months slowly winding our way across Mexico between mostly AirBnBs, and the occasional cheap motel or wild camping spot. 

The environments we've camped in have been primarily semi-arid, arid, xeric schrubland, and desert. Water was usually scarce and so our time spent wild camping was limited. We did very well though.

But now we are finally heading towards the tropics and we expect to spend much longer amounts of time in the bush, especially as our bikes are intended for aggressive off-road terrain.

How to make a donohi (Japanese/ninja body warmer),"Hello everyone, today I’ll give you the knowledge to make a donohi and what it’s purpose/alternative purpose can be.
Warning I do not take credit for the videos provided it’s simply to help the original poster and help spread the knowledge.

I’m not an expert I’m just spreading the knowledge of an alternative body warmer so if you don’t like this feel free to explain why, they might help others understand the tool.

I hope you like the post and have a nice day.

A donohi is a tool to warm up the body it’s made of metal like copper, brass or bronze, and iron/steel.

The use of the donohi is to wrap and pack the metal tube of char cloth to light and warm up the body, if properly constructed you shouldn’t burn be careful to what you wear as well.

Synthetic clothing may melt due to the heat of the donohi, you can get hot enough to sweat from the heat so if you’re warm remove and place it elsewhere so you up that area of the body.

Wear light clothing in layers and place the donohi near the outer layers to keep air flow and heat circulation up, the reason to wear light clothing and in layers is to keep the weight down and to let up some heat easier.

A donohi was made by ninjas to keep warm in the winter months and bring fire building kits with them to either extend or to relight the donohi.

Char cloth or birch fungus can be used to warm up the body, stay hydrated and remove if to hot, check if there are burns, this is not gonna replacement those expensive clothing that use electricity to warm you up or those one time use hand warmers you buy at the stores, this is if you’re on a budget for a permanent heater and tinder box basically a multi use item.

Leather gloves?,"Just curious if anybody is using a waterproofer on their leather gloves?  I used Obenaufs HDLP on a pair of leather, unlined ranchers and it seems to be working out very well.  I now have a couple of pairs of nice leather winter gloves and wondering if anybody has suggestions?

My top three thoughts are:

1. Obenauf's HDLP.  I have used this on boots as well as gloves and its top notch.  This will be my default choice in the future.  Unfortunately I am out and don't like it on boots due to multiple delamination problems it has caused.
2. Huberd's Shoe Grease.  This is my current go-to for leather footwear and works awesome.  Thinner and less long-lasting than Obenaufs.  This is my #2 selection, but given that I have an inventory on hand it might get used.
3. Nikwax leather wax.  I have used this on leather boots with fairly poor performance.  Does seem to soften the leather a little and provide good initial waterproofing but wears off quickly and it slippery.  Probably going to avoid this.

Does anybody have experience with an option I should consider?  While waterproofing IS important, I would like to balance it with breath ability.

I'm giving away a first aid course I made - for free!,"I know this isn't exactly wilderness survival, and I hope it's ok to post this here. I feel like this is one of those posts which are really easy to skip but can actually (in a really practical way) increase our chances of survival in this world.

Cardiac arrests and cardiovascular diseases are currently the number one cause of death in the world. Twice as much as cancer, and close to 600 times more than terrorist attacks. Most people think CPR isn't that important, but the fact of the matter is, **if a person doesn't receive CPR until an ambulance arrives he practically has no chance of survival.**

I just finished making a Udemy course that I put a ton of effort in, and I really hope this will help people get prepared, and hopefully sharing this might save a life somewhere out there.  
I'm not asking anything in return tbh, I'd just appreciate if you enroll in it only if you're actually planning to take it, and that you will consider leaving me a rating.

Electric Lighter for my Fire Kit,"When I first saw an electric, USB rechargeable lighter, I scoffed at the idea. I wondered how useful, versatile, or effective an electric lighter could possibly be in practice. Eventually I started reading the reviews and was compelled by what I read. Eventually, I bought one.

It's very important to note that a lighter is only one part of my fire kit. For me, a fire kit includes a lighter, coated matches, ferro rod + striker, Fresnel lens, various forms of tinder (e.g. Vaseline with cotton, tinder wick, fatwood stick) and often an accelerant like alcohol-based hand sanitizer. I place my fire kit essentials into two separate containers of different sizes. A small one is carried on my person and another larger one is carried in my bag. The two kits are the result of me having my kit lost (or stolen) and being left with nothing. I've been in situations where I only had one method to start a fire and that method failed due to moisture, wind, or both. I've also been in situations where I ran out of fire kit supplies (i.e. ran out of matches, lighter fluid gone, etc.). The lighters I carry are usually small disposable lighters to avoid carrying lighter fluid but those can break or run out of fuel.  So, I always carry multiple means to start a fire in various conditions. My small fire kit fits into an Altoids tin. The larger kit is kept in a slightly larger tin that originally held chocolates.

The rechargeable electric lighter is a new option for my fire kit. I can't make lighter fluid, but I have or carry the means to make electricity at the home, on the go, or in the bush. In an emergency I can charge the lighter using my hand-crank generator, battery bank, solar cell, automobile, or laptop. I've started numerous fires with my electric lighter and find it to be nearly as easy to use as a traditional lighter. The operation is a little different, so it will take some practice, but becoming proficient is not hard. It's very important to note that an electric lighter is not for everyone or every situation. Also, the quality of the lighters vary by manufacturer.

I've included a photo (not a link) of the first lighter I purchased. I've since purchased a couple others to experiment. I didn't include a link because this is not a sales pitch for a specific brand or vendor. Do some research to find one that fits your budget and context-of-use. For me, I'll continue to pack a small micro-sized flame lighter in my kit but I'll be adding the electric lighter as another option.

Question for people will knowledge regarding tanning your own hides,"Hey guys, so I’m confused on some aspects of tanning. For one, In pretty much all step by step guides, they say the first step is to dry the hide, either by salting or air drying, then next to soak in warm water before moving onto the tanning process. Why dry the hide if you are just going to re-soak it? Is there a specific reason for this?

Also I see many different methods on the web, some with many more steps than others. For example, one process instructs to simply to flesh, dry the hide, soak it, then apply brains or egg yolk then work it into the hide until it’s dry and smoke it to make it water proof (such as here https://www.lehmans.com/blog/rabbitry-part-2-tanning-hides) 

Another method which is in a book I purchased “the ultimate guide to skinning and tanning“ by Monte Burch goes through a much more detailed process of fleshing, drying, soaking, liming, neutralizing, pickling, scudding, second pickling, second neutralizing, tanning, oiling, drying/softening. Is this simply a better and more advanced method than the egg/brain tanning described above? Will both work but the latter provide better outcomes? Will the egg/brain as described above method even work and preserve my hide long term? Is one better for certain applications? 

Sorry I know this is long but Any answers Will be greatly appreciated

Writing survival fiction for nanowrimo - help?,"I'm hoping to write a survival story this month for NaNoWriMo. I want you guys to give me examples of survival thoughts and procedures to make my writing realistic. 

For example, maybe you observed dark clouds in the distance and concluded that there would be heavy rain at night, so you adjusted your survival priorities towards shelter. You only ate a small amount of foraged roots that day, but you found a proper cave and had time to set up a rain catcher, which allowed you to fill your water containers. 

Context:

* Set in post-collapse future (after 2100), so I need to consider ecological destruction or restructuring of insect species, trees, bees, etc.
* Climate is temperate confider forest in decline. Topography is hilly/mountainous.
* 1-2 people, one with a few years of survival experience and the other without
* At one point, main character will have good gear (knife, collapsible shelter, water bottle, some medicine, multitool, saw, awl), but at another point they will have minimal gear (only what was on their person, not in backpack)

Closed cell foam sleeping mats. Another look.,"Hi all, with the increased popularity of inflatable sleeping mats in the past few years I just wanted to make a case for carrying one or two thin, closed cell foam mats both for day hikes and overnighters. 
We all know that a foam mat is warm and dry to sit on or lay down for a rest, and they don’t puncture and go flat like inflatables can, but there’s another emergency use too: as wearable, waterproof insulation. 
Unlike the thick, 4 season foam mats, thin ones  of around 1/4 inch fold flat easily either inside or outside a pack. They’re very flexible and will wrap around the torso, held with a length of cord, or wrap around the waist like a kilt, keeping the thighs warm and dry as you walk or work. If you don’t mind making a head sized cut in one you can wear it as a tunic, tied with a cord.
They’re cheap, super light and versatile and can be quickly repaired with super glue. I typically carry one whenever I travel in warmer weather and two in winter. I’ve slept on one in airports, bus stations, ferry docks etc and hiked in them too. For sleeping I use one under a bivvy bag or tent and the other inside.",0,1604409433,carlbernsen,5,1,True,2020-11-03,"closed cell foam sleeping mats. another look. hi all, with the increased popularity of inflatable sleeping mats in the past few years i just wanted to make a case for carrying one or two thin, closed cell foam mats both for day hikes and overnighters.

Guitar strings!,"Was reorganizing one of my bug-out bags, and ran across something I don't think has been mentioned on here before: the easiest and most reliable snare I've ever used, a steel, high-E guitar string with a ball end. I keep 4 in my BOB. 

I have used these in the wild, and they are supremely easy. First, find a rabbit or animal run that looks well used, and locate a small tree or solid bush next to it. Thread the bare end of the guitar string through the ball end, like threading a needle, forming the snare loop. Firmly attach the bare end of the string to the anchor point, so that the snare loop is about 10"" wide and hanging in the run. Check your snares at least once daily, up to three times if you can. The wire will securely trap the animal, and often strangle it if it gets around their neck.

Rattlesnake,"So I’m writing this out of frustration, I’m really mad at myself. I grew up in a rural area where if you saw a rattlesnake, you never gave it a second chance to be seen again. However for job reasons I’ve had to move to a more urban area. Today the biggest rattlesnake I’ve seen in my life (over 6 feet easily) was on the other side of my fence. I’ve been told that this snake has been seen before when I first moved here. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to shoot it because I don’t own a quiet gun (22lr or something of the sort) because of the area I live in, and when attempting to kill it with a shovel I missed as it went into some shrub area. I understand some people will say let it be, but this snake did not show fear as it only rattle for a couple seconds, and to me that shows an immense amount of confidence in its self which can be bad, such as humans feeding a gator or bear.

Best Weapon (Information),"One major concern among survivalists, is the concern of ammo for self defense and hunting. I am making this post to provide a cheap longterm solution for ammo and projectile weapons, below.

Guns
Guns are a great tool because of their accuracy, and depending on the gun, can last a very long time with proper maintenance. However, the major issue with guns is the cost and storage of ammo. If your family is experiencing a regional or national emergency, the COMPLETE stockpile of ammo is probably not on your priority list.

Crossbows and Compound Bows
These weapons are extremely accurate and use reusable ammo, but require in-shop maintenance due to the requirement of necessary heavy equipment. Since this is the case, having a crossbow is not recommended unless for some reason you have a massive supply of crossbow parts and crossbow maintenance equipment on a large property that you can rely on for hunting, during a regional or national emergency. Even then, the more parts of a weapon, the more things can go wrong, and therefore a higher chance of not having the required crossbow parts. Another issue is the fact that you have to have a large supply of crossbow string, since this can wear out/brake in 4-8 years. Also note, that string can decompose after 20-40 years with constant direct sunlight. You also need to wax the strings before usage, and take the string down afterwards.

Recurve Bows
The major benefit of this weapon is that it is extremely accurate and the ammo is reusable, while it does not require in-shop maintenance. However, I highly recommend a recurve Riser and Recurve Limbs by Gillo, Hyt, Spigarelli or Win &amp; Win, which can total to anywhere from $300 to $1000, but last forever (minus bow string replacement). However, if you need or want to be cheap, you can choose Samick, which will total from $150 to $300 After the bow, arrows, and bow string wax. However, the major issue with recurve bows is the requirement to store bow string, as it can also wear out or brake in 4-8 years. Also note, that string can decompose after 20-40 years with constant direct sunlight. You also need to wax the strings before usage, and take the string down afterwards.

What is the best solution...?

Blowguns
This weapon can use reusable ammo, is very accurate after some practice, and does not require in-shop maintenance or any if much maintenance in general. Since this weapon uses air, there is not much that can go wrong unless something done to the arrows or the blowgun itself by the user, such as heavy banging or bending. Even then, a blowgun is usually made of metal, which really prevents damage, such as the case with the 5 foot two-piece big bore steel blowgun. The best and only blowgun I would buy is the Big Bore Steel 5 Foot Two-Piece Blowgun, since it is the only product that is more than 4 feet. Also, the blowgun itself is very well made and is very durable/strong, but I would buy their .625 broadhead darts (not the mini broadhead darts) since the darts that come with the kit are not long enough (mini broadhead darts) or strong/heavy enough (wooden bamboo darts) to penetrate flesh. Not only is the .625 broadhead darts longer than the .625 mini broadhead darts, the broadhead of the .625 broadhead darts is wider and longer, allowing it to more easily penetrate larger game such as deer, bear, elk, moose, etc. Although they explicitly say that the 2 foot extension piece does not fit the .625 model in the description, it does, I bought it and use it with the .625 5 foot blowgun. Just trust me on the fact that it will connect to the 5 foot blowgun, and you WILL need the extra 2 feet to guarantee the take down of larger game. Longer the length of the blowgun, deeper the penetration and distance of the dart, minus the type of dart. The downside to blowguns is that they only shoot accurately 20-40 yards (60 to 120 feet), or 20-70 yards (60 to 210 feet) if you add the extension and larger/longer broadhead darts. However, this should be close enough for most animal encounters, especially with camouflage.

DIY ARROW LOCATOR
Arrows can very easily get lost in grass as short as lawn grass because the metal arrows penetrate deep into the ground, sideways. Therefore, I came up with a solution to increase your chances to find your arrows, using reflection during low light. 

First, you will need to buy $5-10 WHITE reflective tape. Next, you will need to put INDIVIDUAL pieces down the shaft of each arrow, and one around the arrow tailhead.

Next, you will need a fresnal lens (pocket size will work) and a disco ball. By shining the light from the sun through the fresnal lens to the disco ball, it will shine bright dots allover. This, will increase the chances of reflecting the white tape on the arrows, which will locate your arrows. I recommend doing this near where you lost your arrow, to increase the chances of arrow location. I also do not recommend a flashlight for finding the arrow itself, or shining it on the disco ball because batteries run out and/or lose their charge over time, not being longeterm.",0,1601651113,Clinician,10,1,True,2020-10-02,"best weapon (information) one major concern among survivalists, is the concern of ammo for self defense and hunting. i am making this post to provide a cheap longterm solution for ammo and projectile weapons, below.

guns
guns are a great tool because of their accuracy, and depending on the gun, can last a very long time with proper maintenance. however, the major issue with guns is the cost and storage of ammo. if your family is experiencing a regional or national emergency, the complete stockpile of ammo is probably not on your priority list.

crossbows and compound bows
these weapons are extremely accurate and use reusable ammo, but require in-shop maintenance due to the requirement of necessary heavy equipment. since this is the case, having a crossbow is not recommended unless for some reason you have a massive supply of crossbow parts and crossbow maintenance equipment on a large property that you can rely on for hunting, during a regional or national emergency. even then, the more parts of a weapon, the more things can go wrong, and therefore a higher chance of not having the required crossbow parts. another issue is the fact that you have to have a large supply of crossbow string, since this can wear out/brake in 4-8 years. also note, that string can decompose after 20-40 years with constant direct sunlight. you also need to wax the strings before usage, and take the string down afterwards.

recurve bows
the major benefit of this weapon is that it is extremely accurate and the ammo is reusable, while it does not require in-shop maintenance. however, i highly recommend a recurve riser and recurve limbs by gillo, hyt, spigarelli or win &amp; win, which can total to anywhere from $300 to $1000, but last forever (minus bow string replacement). however, if you need or want to be cheap, you can choose samick, which will total from $150 to $300 after the bow, arrows, and bow string wax. however, the major issue with recurve bows is the requirement to store bow string, as it can also wear out or brake in 4-8 years. also note, that string can decompose after 20-40 years with constant direct sunlight. you also need to wax the strings before usage, and take the string down afterwards.

what is the best solution...?

blowguns
this weapon can use reusable ammo, is very accurate after some practice, and does not require in-shop maintenance or any if much maintenance in general. since this weapon uses air, there is not much that can go wrong unless something done to the arrows or the blowgun itself by the user, such as heavy banging or bending. even then, a blowgun is usually made of metal, which really prevents damage, such as the case with the 5 foot two-piece big bore steel blowgun. the best and only blowgun i would buy is the big bore steel 5 foot two-piece blowgun, since it is the only product that is more than 4 feet. also, the blowgun itself is very well made and is very durable/strong, but i would buy their .625 broadhead darts (not the mini broadhead darts) since the darts that come with the kit are not long enough (mini broadhead darts) or strong/heavy enough (wooden bamboo darts) to penetrate flesh. not only is the .625 broadhead darts longer than the .625 mini broadhead darts, the broadhead of the .625 broadhead darts is wider and longer, allowing it to more easily penetrate larger game such as deer, bear, elk, moose, etc. although they explicitly say that the 2 foot extension piece does not fit the .625 model in the description, it does, i bought it and use it with the .625 5 foot blowgun. just trust me on the fact that it will connect to the 5 foot blowgun, and you will need the extra 2 feet to guarantee the take down of larger game. longer the length of the blowgun, deeper the penetration and distance of the dart, minus the type of dart. the downside to blowguns is that they only shoot accurately 20-40 yards (60 to 120 feet), or 20-70 yards (60 to 210 feet) if you add the extension and larger/longer broadhead darts. however, this should be close enough for most animal encounters, especially with camouflage.

Replacing old US Navy mummy bag. Need some advice in an unfamiliar brand.,"TLDR: replacing old US Navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. New target for a nearly year round bang is the Slumberjack ""Grand Lake 20f sleeping bag"". I know next to nothing about Slumberjack and would love to hear if any one has experience with this specific sleeping bag or one that has the same qualities.

I'm looking to replace my old US Navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. I acquired it in my early teen years and have been stubbornly using it as my go-to sleeping bag for any and all occasion for the past 13-14 years. Whether it be late fall car camping in pretty low temps to backpacking 5-8 miles to the campsite in August... I live in Utah for reference.

Don't get me wrong, I adore this bag and it has held up beyond my wildest expectations. I have never felt too cold while in it, even to the point of sweating when it's snowing outside the tent. It still looks nearly untouched after some rough bush over the past decade. It only learned the pleasure of a protective compression sack this year and still the only sign that it's been used and abused is the ""US NAVY"" on the underside is nearly faded away.

My only gripe is, if my scale is accurate, packed up it weighs just over 13 pounds. That's a lot of weight to be strapped to the bottom of my Mardingtop 65+10L pack going up mountains in 90-100 degree weather. The cold nights where I sit in my tent with my dog bundled up grinning a snarky grin, knowing I'm the most comfy person at the site are no longer worth hauling that mattress around.

After spending most of the day going through any market place I could find online, I believe I have found the bag that match's what I'm wanting nearly exactly. It's still on the heavier side, but cuts down the weight more then half. Also, after using the Navy bag for so long I have grown accustomed to being in my ""nest"" as I'm fond of calling it. 
Only thing that sucks, I have no knowledge or experience with the brand so I'm hesitant to pull the trigger with it sounding to good to be true.

It's the Slumberjack ""Grand Lake 20f sleeping bag"". Looks to only be sold first hand on their offical website and one of the local Walmarts near me. It hits nearly all of my criteria perfectly, but that's all just from the details on the webpage that seem to very depending on who's selling and where.

Thanks for sticking with it till the end!!",0,1600670854,EnragedJedi,2,1,True,2020-09-21,"replacing old us navy mummy bag. need some advice in an unfamiliar brand. tldr: replacing old us navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. new target for a nearly year round bang is the slumberjack ""grand lake 20f sleeping bag"". i know next to nothing about slumberjack and would love to hear if any one has experience with this specific sleeping bag or one that has the same qualities.

i'm looking to replace my old us navy extreme cold weather mummy bag. i acquired it in my early teen years and have been stubbornly using it as my go-to sleeping bag for any and all occasion for the past 13-14 years. whether it be late fall car camping in pretty low temps to backpacking 5-8 miles to the campsite in august... i live in utah for reference.

don't get me wrong, i adore this bag and it has held up beyond my wildest expectations. i have never felt too cold while in it, even to the point of sweating when it's snowing outside the tent. it still looks nearly untouched after some rough bush over the past decade. it only learned the pleasure of a protective compression sack this year and still the only sign that it's been used and abused is the ""us navy"" on the underside is nearly faded away.

my only gripe is, if my scale is accurate, packed up it weighs just over 13 pounds. that's a lot of weight to be strapped to the bottom of my mardingtop 65+10l pack going up mountains in 90-100 degree weather. the cold nights where i sit in my tent with my dog bundled up grinning a snarky grin, knowing i'm the most comfy person at the site are no longer worth hauling that mattress around.

after spending most of the day going through any market place i could find online, i believe i have found the bag that match's what i'm wanting nearly exactly. it's still on the heavier side, but cuts down the weight more then half. also, after using the navy bag for so long i have grown accustomed to being in my ""nest"" as i'm fond of calling it. 
only thing that sucks, i have no knowledge or experience with the brand so i'm hesitant to pull the trigger with it sounding to good to be true.

it's the slumberjack ""grand lake 20f sleeping bag"". looks to only be sold first hand on their offical website and one of the local walmarts near me. it hits nearly all of my criteria perfectly, but that's all just from the details on the webpage that seem to very depending on who's selling and where. seen to many adds boast a total weight only to see the actual weight being a few pounds more or less. 

the few reviews their are don't really hit the points i'm wanting to know and there are no youtube reviews on it at all. if anyone has used this specific sleeping bag or know of any that align with it and are even less weight, i would love to hear about it!

Opinions on ESEE4,"So I am looking for a decent full tang knive that can take some abuse in the range of about 150€. I only own 2 Gerbers (Gator 1and Warrant) and this would be my first 'expensive' knive. I came across ESEE and the model 4 seems to fulfill my expectations in terms of blade size and durability, however there are still some issues I need someones opinion on:

\- Handle size. Apparently the handle is too small? I don't have particularly large hands for a man, I'd say about average (glove size about 10) but still...

\- Sheath. From what I can see the sheath does not provide a locking mechanism for the knive to not fall out unless it is some sort of clipping mechanism inside the sheath? Does anyone have any experience here?

\- Steel. Most of their models are using the 1095 which apparently makes them extremely durable but you will have to care for it more (grease the blade to prevent corrosion). They do have a 440 version of the ESEE but they state in their warranty explanation that this one will not be as durable.

I think wel all need to see this as a reminder that Knowledge &gt; Tools.,"I'm talking about [these 3 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBVieA9ifLc&amp;list=PLwEYCMnBm-lL6oyu528svgHxa0JUnzLE0) by YouTuber Vinniesdayoff that demonstrate using a crappy non-locking folding knife as a survival knife. 

I found this a couple of months ago, and it opened my eyes. I'm an owner of a Fallkniven A1 and S1 knives. Bought mostly with the idea that a strong reliable knife is the way to gon, but if you understand your tools and know a handful of skills even the crappiest of knives can get you a long way. Since then I've been using a Swiss Army Knife (Alox Farmer X) more and more as a way of practice my skills and I must say, it changed my philosophy thoroughly when it comes to wood processing tools.

Now I'm not saying you should all replace your fixed blade knife in your kit with a SAK. But if you consider buying/selecting a knife for your kit, maybe consider a smaller option. When it comes to a survival kit, weight is always a big concern. Besides that, smaller blades are better suited for finer task and these finer tasks can also be very important in a survival situation. 

Most of all, practice with different tools for the job. Know what to do when you don't have the ideal tool at hand, learn how to split wood without batoning on your blade or without an axe, and learn how to properly use folding knives where you're at. 

It's a good ideology in general when it comes to honing outdoor skills, not just knives.

This may sound like a stupid question: is a spear a good addition to a survival pack/wilderness outing?,"I live in an area where there are many predatory animals: cougars, bears, etc and although I know it’s very rare to have an interaction with one, I still want to be prepared in the rare case that an interaction would turn into an attack. 

Now I know bear spray and firearms are better but I don’t have a license so I was thinking a spear would be good since it would limit the chances of the animal getting close, and you can get some poking done to hopefully get the animals to leave. 

Also might make for a better than nothing hunting tool if you know how to use it well for medium sized game (if you’re as quiet and nimble as a panther of course).

Question about Trapping and game types,"This question is about Wilderness Survival, BUT for some rulesets I am making for D&amp;D. It doesn't seem to be explicitly against the rules but...\*shug\*

I am looking to get a better understanding of non-region specific game types that can realistically be caught with traps. I tried Googling it and I got some good info, but mostly I was digging through PETA and Animal Rights pages that overwhelmed the search. I figured this subreddit would be a good place to get some insight from real people who know what they are talking about.

My players in D&amp;D have found that they love trapping game (and hunting/fishing) while traveling. They set their traps at night and check them in the morning, the result of the trap is based on their ""Survival"" skill. Currently we are one session in, and I've been winging it with generalizations depending on their rolls ""You caught nothing"", ""You caught a squirrel/hare"", ""You caught a boar/deer"", ""You caught a bear"" (In a very rare instance).

I'd like to make this somewhat more realistic. I realize that D&amp;D can never be realistic, especially in that there is just a generic ""Hunting Trap"" rather than something appropriately sized and baited for the specific game. I'm looking to get a handle on animals that can realistically be caught in a trap.

So far I have:

Small Game

* squirrel
* rabbit/hare
* rat

Medium Game

* fox
* lynx
* beaver
* otter

Large Game

* boar
* deer

Special Game (turns into a fight)

* bear
* moose (??)
* wolf
* panther/cougar/mt. lion

Need a wilderness survival instructor for training course.,"Hi all, I'm trying to find a Wilderness survival instructor for a paid instructor gig at my local Rod &amp; Gun club.

Long story short, I proposed a class to my club president where we could offer our members a course in wilderness survival at our gun club, probably an overnight stay in your shelter that you make and training on the techniques of trapping and resource gathering, possibly with food provided because there'd be no real trapping.

Obviously we wouldn't touch on many of the things that are second nature to many of you, but it would allow our members to begin the journey in a safe controlled area (we own about 80 acres in Upstate NY). They wouldn't be too far from safe water and a road at any time.

Encounter with a Mama (Black) Bear,"Hello I was recently hiking on the Coast in the Pacific Northwest and had a close encounter with a Mama black bear and two cubs.


I was hiking and saw a few fellow hikers yelling and whistling at something in the distance. A moment later I saw the outline of a bear on the beach zig zagging back and forth from the water to the forest line. The hikers said the Mama bear and cubs came out behind them from the woods. We watched for a second before realizing the bears were still coming towards us. 


We began yelling, using the emergency whistles we had on us, banging our hiking poles loudly over head, and saying ""hey bear!"" in a loud voice. Nothing seemed to stop her.


Figuring if we gave her ample space she would pass, or retreat into the woods. Unfortunately we backed (slowly) towards the water to let her pass (she had about 75yards of beach to safely pass) instead she stopped, and made a 90 degree turn straight at us.


Once we realized she was walking right at us and wasn't stopping, and the only way out was to go swimming or try to climb a sea stack and having forgotten my bear spray in the car, I pulled out my pistol and fired once into the air. To our surprise the cubs ran but mama just stopped and stared.  We then fired twice more and she ran. We then decided wading through the water would be the safest and fastest way out. 


Less than five minutes later she was back on the beach in the same spot where we had fired the shots.


I know bears like to bluff to get you to back down, however since we were stuck with our backs toward the ocean with nowhere to retreat, would she have attacked had  she gotten closer? 


Also lesson learned I won't be forgetting my bearspray again. Also ""bears are more scared of you then you are of them"" that I've heard all my life, really diddnt seem to be the case, she brazenly walked towards 5 of us being big, and loud which diddnt have any effect on her whatsoever.",0,1600192665,Thejailer,60,1,True,2020-09-15,"encounter with a mama (black) bear hello i was recently hiking on the coast in the pacific northwest and had a close encounter with a mama black bear and two cubs.

Animal attack cheat sheet (for animals found in the PNW),"I frequently go camping, hiking, or otherwise exploring. I’m insanely anxious and I always overthink my safety, so I’m sharing with you guys the list of techniques I’ve made to avoid and/or survive attacks by some wild animals that we have here in the PNW.


COUGARS/MOUNTAIN LIONS-

If approached- Do NOT run. Do not turn your back to them, they are ambush predators. Make yourself look bigger to appear threatening. Maintain constant eye contact as you yell, make loud noises, and wave your arms about. Try to scare them off. Again, do NOT run as they will most likely attack.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. Try to remain on your feet and protect your head and neck. Fight back by any means possible. This means punching, kicking, any weapons you may have or nearby objects that can be used as a weapon.


BLACK BEARS-

If you see a black bear, respect its space. They will usually avoid you in turn as they are fairly timid. If you must pass them, give them a wide berth. They would rather flee than fight.

If approached- If you have children in your party, keep them close. Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand and face the bear directly. Speak calmly to identify yourself as something that is not a prey animal. If that does not work, make yourself look larger, and make loud noises to scare the bear away. Avoid direct eye contact.

If attacked- Do NOT play dead. If you can escape to a safe location like a car or house, do it, but if not, then fight back. Black bears will not leave you alone if you play dead. Concentrate kicks and blows to the bear’s face and snout.


GRIZZLY BEARS-

If you see cubs, slowly back away. They are cute and may actually be intrigued by you, but do not interact since mama bear is probably close by and will certainly kick your ass. 

If approached- Ready your bear spray if you carry it. Stand tall and make yourself look large. If the bear stands on its hind legs, it is most likely just curiosity. Slowly back away with your bear spray in your hand. Ideal spraying distance is 40-50 feet.

If attacked- Lay down and do NOT fight back. This will intensify the attack as the bear is usually trying to neutralize you as a threat. Assume a fetal position, protecting your stomach with your knees, and lace your fingers behind your neck to protect it. If the bear stops attacking, stay “dead” for at least 15-20 minutes because it will linger to see if you’re dead or just injured. If the bear is gone, back away slowly rather than running just in case they are watching from a distance. If the attack persists after you’ve played dead, fight back only as a last resort, and aim for the bear’s eyes and snout.


WOLVERINE-

Wolverines have a reputation for being scary, but they are more likely to just throw a tantrum in order to scare you since bluffing is their forte. They are also not large- similar to a medium sized dog.

You will rarely encounter these in the wild since they are shy and solitary creatures. As far as I know, there are no cases of wolverines attacking humans. Just go back the way you came, or if you continue, give them space and keep an eye out. It’s unlikely that they’ll hurt you.


PORCUPINE-

Porcupines are not often seen in the daytime as they are nocturnal and timid. They are short sighted and easily startled, so if you encounter a porcupine, walk a large distance around it if possible. They may swish their tail around which makes a strange noise, but unless you scare or threaten them, they are unlikely to quill you.

If quilled- remove them as quickly as possible so that the swelling doesn’t make it harder. Cut off the long end so that you can get a good grip on it and tug on it. If you can, do not twist or break it off. Do not use bare hands because this can injure your hand as well. If possible, wash the wounds well with soap and water and then apply antibiotic cream. Watch the wounds for redness, swelling, or itching. If you are quilled in the face or if the quills will not come out, see a doctor.

Emergency Flint &amp; Steel Fire when you have no flint and no steel.,"If you don't have a purpose-built steel striker, many other things will work.  Do you have something else that is carbon steel?  Or can you find an old tool in a cellar hole or dump?  Can you salvage a part from a junk car or atv wreck?  Keep an eye out as you walk along the trail for a piece of metal.  But it has to be carbon steel-  not stainless steel, and not soft steel like the typical nail, sheet metal, angle iron, etc.

Is your knife carbon steel?  If not, then what about your ax?  If you're not sure then hit it with a hard rock.

What rocks are available in the area?  Flint or chert are good, if you can find it.  Quartz will also work, along with many other rocks.  Basalt can work if you knap a sharp edge on it.  Granite can work because it has quartz in it.  If you're not a geologist, don't worry.  You don't have to be an expert at identifying rocks.  You just have to locate a hard rock, not one one that is soft or crumbles easily.  Then hit it with your piece of steel.  If you see sparks, you are good to go.  Some steels are better than others for this purpose as are some rocks.  So with a good kit you could be getting gobs of fat sparks.  If you're improvised kit is only throwing a few, wimpy sparks, that's ok.  It will likely take a little longer for a spark to hit your tinder and catch, but you can make it happen.  Just keep trying.

What kind of metal objects might work?  We already mentioned axes and knives.  And it's not just fixed blade knives.  Many antique and vintage pocket knives are carbon steel and throw wonderful sparks.  Learn how to identify the satisfying grey of old carbon tool steel.  If you are carrying an ax, you likely have a file to sharpen it.  Most files make great steel strikers.  Chisels often work well.  Hammers can throw sparks.  You should know that many tools are deferentially heat treated.  That means one area is harder than another part of the tool.  The hammer head's striking surface might throw sparks, but not the top.  The file's side might spark, but not the handle.  Pliers and wire cutters can throw sparks and also saw blades and many other tools.  Car parts, motorcycle parts, and other machine components are something to check.  Not everything will work, but you only have to find one thing that does.  Understand that you should clean grease and remove paint and rust from the striking area.  The cleaner it is, the better it will work.

It helps to practice with found rocks in your area, and also with various metal objects.  If you are poor, or unable to source a professionally-made steel striker in your area, you can make your own flint &amp; steel kit.  Simply cut up, or break down the metal object to the size you want.  Find a rock, and knap a sharp edge.  Find some sort of metal tin for charring cloth, punk wood, fungus, and other things.  You're good to go.

"My ""teepee"" style fires keep falling down, oftentimes before I can even light them. What am I doing wrong?","I can build any other style of camp fire perfectly, but the teepee/conical arrangement has me stumped. I really want to get the hang of it because it's a great all-purpose type of fire, burns fast and hot and gives you a nice bed of coals for cooking. Plus it's the ""classic"" camp fire!

I usually use fallen limbs and sticks, about as thick as my wrist, for fuel. Getting these to lean together in a teepee fashion is impossible. They just fall down over and over.

According to all the diagrams I've seen and videos I've watched, they should just magically... Lean together? But they don't for me.

Top 10 ways to stay alive in the wilderness," 

Just lurking on this subreddit for a while, but I've decided to create an account to share something I've found useful.  

My grandfather was a Native American, and he taught me the ways of his people. From an early age, he would take me out and teach me which berries were safe to eat, which plants had healing properties, and how to track the deer through the forests of Kentucky.  He taught me how to live off the land.  After he died, I lost all contact with my heritage, but his teachings stayed with me.

 When I was laid off from my plant management job last year and the bank started foreclosing on my house, I knew it was time to put those teachings to the test. I bought a one-way ticket to Alaska, and spent a few months trekking through the wilderness with just a knife, a change of clothes, and a book of Native American lore that my grandfather had given me.  

Now, I live in a cave in the middle of a dense forest, and I hope to never return to society. I drink fresh bear blood whenever I can catch a bear, and eat wild berries and fish. 

Here is my top 10 ways to live a long time in the wilderness:  

1. Avoid other people. People are the carriers of disease, and you definitely do not want to catch anything. Your chances of surviving an illness are a lot lower out in the wilderness than in a hospital, so you need to keep your immune system as strong as possible.  

2. Avoid other people. Seriously, did I mention that you should avoid other people? Because you should.  

3. Find a cave, and make it your home. One time I found an abandoned beaver lodge, but caves are best. The Native Americans used to live in caves too; you are keeping with your heritage! 

4. Find water, and make that your home too. Make sure you can easily access the water. Build a bathing area, and be sure to keep it clean, since you want to avoid getting sick.  

5. Set traps for game, but do not eat the meat right away. You don't want to get food poisoning and die of dysentery. Eat the meat after sitting for at least six hours.  

6. Avoid other people, as mentioned earlier. Seriously, if you see another human being, there is a good chance they might kill and eat you. Unless you recognize them and have some sort of relationship.  

7. Avoid other people, once again. Even if you do recognize the person. They might not be friendly!  

8. Castor Beans can be used to make ricin. Ricin is a great poison.  

9. If you don't have anything sharp, you can always use your hands. There are more than twenty types of hand techniques that you can use to kill a person. The carotid artery hold is the easiest. 

10. If you don't have anything sharp, or your hands, you can always use your...  The human brain is the most powerful muscle in the body. It can crush a skull with relative ease, especially if you know the right place to push.

A little help with snowy survival...,"I'll preface this by saying that none of the information I'm looking for is for practical / real life use. I'm working on a writing project and I'm finding that I wish I knew more about certain wilderness survival skills. With that being said...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a piece of writing that takes place in a very cold and snowy environment. My main character has been living in isolation, off the land for some amount of time. The climate isn't arctic but there are several feet of snow (at least) year round. There are plenty of trees (coniferous stuff) and lots of animals (both dangerous and not). In my head I'm picturing a colder version of the old growth forests of the pacific northwest in America. 

My main character survives by foraging and trapping I think, but I'm not fully sure how reasonable this is. I suppose my first question is: can a person survive, on their own, in conditions like I've described? 

What I'm trying to figure out specifically is what my main character's day-to-day looks like. What is the best method for building a semi-permanent shelter? What are some of the biggest dangerous to look out for that aren't immediately intuitive? Obviously I know that she is going to need to keep warm and fed, but are there other implications of the setting and environment that I'm not thinking of?

I like the idea of her getting a decent chunk of her daily food from traps she set, but I have absolutely no experience with designing, building, or setting traps. Any guidance at all on this topic would be super appreciated. 

My setting is post-apocalyptic sci-fi so I've got some wiggle room when it comes to what technology is available but obviously providing power to any kind of tech will be a hurdle, especially without a whole lot of sun. I already have a few fun ideas like a hovering pod to store food in so that bears can't get to it, but most of those details are being ironed out after I figure out the limits of snowy survival. 

My experience in this stuff begins and ends with digging out and sleeping in a snow cave when I was in boy scouts. I've been backpacking in warmer climates and my family growing up was pretty outdoorsy, but I'm just feeling a little lost on the living-off-the-land-in-a-never-ending-winter thing.

Hand to Hand Self Defense Against the Undead.,"The title is exactly the topic; What weapon would you prefer to have when facing hordes of the undead?

I read a long time ago, in a very well written book by Max Brooks, that an ideal weapon to use against zombies may be something that you can use effectively, and as far from the clammy hands of the dead, that you can. This, Max proffered that the Machete was a smart weapon to wield against the shambling dead.

Growing up, I’ve thought this would be smart. But would’ve rather preferred something with multiple functions like a trench knife, that I can use to punch and stab quickly and effectively; but now I’m seeing that, while a trench knife is neat and all, it’s not practical.

And by far the most dangerous part of a zombie is it’s ability to grab you, so that it can bite you. Thus…if you eliminate the hand of the zombie, you take away its ability to grapple and hold. A heavy, thick machete with a decent edge should be sufficient for hacking and chopping.

Vultures in a zombie apocalypse,"I’ve never seen anyone bring up the utility/usefulness of vultures in any discussion board or media about a zombie apocalypse. I think they would be probably one of the coolest/best animals that could aid a human in a zombie apocalypse.

It would be a very opportunistic strategy to survival because you would need a large enclosure to house a flock of vultures and an area where you have access to lots of vulture nesting areas. Sure, you could have just one vulture, but you’d basically just be a crazy Falconer, using the vulture to hunt for sport and not necessarily utility. 

In a zombie apocalypse, you would most certainly want a flock of vultures. Vultures would serve a couple of roles in a zombie apocalypse: waste management, fighters, and surveillance. 

Vultures are typically extremely social animals and form communities, with some flocks having hundreds of individuals. The way that we would form our own flock is by stealing as many vulture eggs as possible and then raising them as our own. In a sense, we would create our own flock and become a part of it, which would be essential to make sure they don’t fly away and it saves us the time of having to tame dozens of individual birds. By providing them with a sufficiently large enclosure, we would always provide the incentive for the vultures to stay as we provide them shelter, community, and a source of water. Food would be provided while cleaning up our territory from zombies and also when taking them on scavenging/looting missions.

Since zombies are literally just walking corpses, vultures would have an absolute blast preying on zombies. In fact, their entire anatomy is designed specifically for tearing into rotten flesh, and when the flesh is all gone, they are even known to eat the bones. So the ideal way to use them in a confrontation with zombies is let them attack the zombies. It would take an unreasonable amount of time for them to kill a zombie, unless trained to do so, so typically their objective would be to just overwhelm the zombies long enough for you to neutralize them.

We can also use the vultures for surveillance. By equipping some vultures with a lightweight, homemade, camera-equipped harness, we would let them fly in circles around our territory while the camera broadcasts the footage to a computer. There would also have to be some sort of antenna to maintain this live feed, I don’t know the first thing about broadcasting video, so I’ll just leave this to the technologically inclined survivors. 

Now, in the United States, we only have 3 kinds of vultures, the Turkey Vulture, the Black Vulture, and the California Condor. The Turkey and Black Vulture live year round in the southern states, while the California Condor only lives in parts of California, Utah, and Arizona. 

In terms of which would be best, the Black Vulture is undoubtedly the answer. This is mainly because of the way in which they scavenge. Black Vultures scavenge in large flocks. Turkey Vultures on the other hand typically only scavenge alone or in pairs. In the wild, flocks of Black Vultures are known to chase away larger Turkey Vultures by overwhelming and chasing them away. The California Condor is not a great choice as there aren’t that many in the wild and they have a hierarchical social system. This social system is a bad idea for our strategy as we want as many members of our flock attacking as possible. If we were to use Condors, only the biggest would strike first, and the others would arrive only after the biggest are done.

The idea with the Black Vultures is that the least amount of work goes into training them, as they already scavenge in flocks and can overpower animals that are larger than them.

TL;DR: A flock of vultures (ideally Black Vultures if in the U.S) could be used to overwhelm/neutralize groups of zombies, keep your territory free of zombie waste, and could be an effective tool of surveillance for your territory from above if given sufficient space and socialized while young.",1,1643007648,Silver_Tomato,0,1,True,2022-01-24,"vultures in a zombie apocalypse i’ve never seen anyone bring up the utility/usefulness of vultures in any discussion board or media about a zombie apocalypse. i think they would be probably one of the coolest/best animals that could aid a human in a zombie apocalypse.

Best Tactic to clear large masses of Zombies without risk,"1. Get a Helicopter (best you already know how to fly one). 

2. Blast with speakers your voice telling survivors to run away from the Helicopter.

3. When you have gathered a large enough crowd of Zombies underneath yourself either drop napalm and burn them in the city or slowly lure them out of the city in a pit where you can burn them.

When you have cleared most of the zombies of a village/city there will probably still be a lot stuck inside of buildings. For this you should have enough people to clear every house one by one. 

Every person should wear something like chainmail. (It only needs to protect from bites therefor best would be if they are made from aluminum bottle caps or something similar).
Over the Chainmail there alway should be clothing that can‘t be grabbed and can‘t get talgend in things.

You should also use silent weapons like bow and arrow, spears and only keep guns as the last resort by your side.

I think there’s too many abandoned cars in zombie movies and games,"I’m playing dying light right now and it’s a great game (probably because none of the ideas are original but they are all executed well)

Magic zombies.,"So a lot of people's strategy for zombies revolve around them rotting. So let's mix it up a bit, they're magical. They ain't rotting and they will stock food wherever it may go. They will not remain stationary, they will continue to seek out prey where ever it goes. They can use basic motor skills beyond just stumbling around and will open doors, smash windows, climb over obstacles and avoid obvious danger. They can't drive cars, but they won't be as easily detoured by a locked door or high wall. You are their food, and nothing else. Regardless of where you hide, they will always gravitate towards the nearest living person. Infection from being bitten or scratched will result in turning within a few hours. Zombies are stronger and faster than their living counter part. You cannot out wait the apocalypse. More zombies will always rise.

I need help with a few things concerning a book I'm writing.,"So I'm writing a book about a zombie apocalypse.

Shotguns and Zombies,"I made a similar post some time ago about the pro and cons of .22 lr Weapons in a Outbreak. No lets do the same with Shotguns. Nearly every Zombie Movie/Series depicts Shotguns as the ideal weapon to put an undead down for good. 

Here are the pros I see in Shotguns (in no particular order)

\-Even in Countries with relatively harsh gun laws allow shotguns as a sportin/hunting weapon (like in Great Britain). So finding ammo is more simple than for other Guns. 

\-Shotguns are good for unskilled shooters, because at least some of the shotgun pellets will hit the undead

\-Shotguns are pretty simple weapons, esspecially break Action Shotguns are idiotproof

\-Shotguns packs a Punch, so you can fight against hostile survivors with it. It maybe dont kill an attacker, but it will throw then to the ground.

\- Shotguns can fire a variety of ammunition. The most common load is ""00 Buckshot"" , but other loads like ""birdshot"" or ""Slugs"" are aviable. Slugs are usefull against armored hostile survivors and are capable of punching through a windshield. 

\-Shotguns can be used to hunt to, making them more than just a simple weapons. With Slugs and Buckshot you can hunt animals like Deer and with birdshot you can hunt birds like Ducks. So a shotgun is a good way to put food on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

And here the cons (again no particular order)

\-Shotguns have some serious recoil

\-Shotgunshells are pretty big so they will take up some room in your backpack

\-most shotguns have internal Magazines. So when you fired your gun empty, the reloading will take a while. And not all double barell shotguns have case extractors. So you will maybe have to pull out the empty shells before you can put in two new ones.

Zombie Behavior analysis,"So one thing that I have been concerned about is if the zombie apocalypse occurs, how will zombies behave. I have a couple of theories from nature the first is from looking at Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani (ant zombie fungus) and the other is from looking at things like rabies and Chronic Wasting Disease. One thing that we notice is that these animals infected with these diseases do not form packs or groups, on the contrary they usually break off from their groups and go it alone and attempt to survive. This is very good for anyone trying to survive because it means that the infected would not have the desire to form hordes.

That being said viruses like to survive and we can see on some level that it may be possible that hordes would start to form as the virus in them starts to evolve and the need for hordes for survival of the infected becomes important. So my question is does anyone have examples of hordes/packs/groups of infected and sick animals in nature sticking to their organizational structure or do their organizational structures always fall apart as members of the group become sick.",1,1641341935,FragUPlenty,0,1,True,2022-01-04,"zombie behavior analysis so one thing that i have been concerned about is if the zombie apocalypse occurs, how will zombies behave. i have a couple of theories from nature the first is from looking at ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani (ant zombie fungus) and the other is from looking at things like rabies and chronic wasting disease. one thing that we notice is that these animals infected with these diseases do not form packs or groups, on the contrary they usually break off from their groups and go it alone and attempt to survive. this is very good for anyone trying to survive because it means that the infected would not have the desire to form hordes.

"The truth about zombies, what you see is not what you would get","What you currently see in the media in regards to ""zombies"" is mostly a Hollywood fake in my opinion. I doubt that people affected with any virus would be able to survive and walk missing limbs and organs. So what would a ""zombie"" virus actually do to a person.

It wouldn't make you magically invulnerable to everything but a headshot that's for sure. People are mechanical and when their mechanical functions are compromised they fail to function. That being said, a ""zombie"" virus would likely cause mental effects such as confusion at first, followed by delirium, restlessness, paranoia, and insomnia. 

In order to survive the virus would have to spread itself and assuming it is not airborne it would likely do this by causing things like excessive urination, watering of the eyes, runny nose, profuse sweating, diarrhea, etc. This would give the virus time to spread to another living organism through the excreted fluids. Now one thing that would need to be addressed is if it can infect other organisms or use them as a carrier. For example a mosquito bites an infected person and drinks his blood, can that mosquito now spread the virus to another person. 

Another issue with the Hollywood's representation of ""zombies"" is that they seem to almost have superhuman stamina, continually coming until their brains are removed from their head. I don't see this as being very accurate. Infected people would likely be very irritable and paranoid but not besides themselves and violence crazed. They would more likely need to be restrained and kept safe as their immune systems tries to fight off the virus. Yes it is possible that people could become momentarily violent it likely wouldn't be difficult to restrain them.

Turning into a ""zombie"" is often portrayed as being very quick but like I said before it would take at least a day for a virus to spread through your body and possibly even longer until you start to feel the negative mental effects. This is because no matter what your built in immune system will fight it for as long as it can before giving up all bodily control to it. Rabies for example takes 1 to 3 months.

Is Downtown St. Louis ideal for the apocalypse? Help me decide.,"So. First off, Downtown St Louis buildings have already experienced post-apocalyptic conditions for 50 years, and those that survived, still stand.


The building I live in was thoroughly looted and filled with standing water from 1970-2017, when it was gut-renovated and turned into a beautiful apartment complex.


When it was constructed, it was the tallest concrete structure in the world, with 23 stories of shopping (it was a mall). Concrete is a very expensive, yet waterproof and mold-resistant, material to build with, and was perfect for long-term abandonment.


Many modern apartment buildings are made with cheaper, yet less durable, wood and glass. Downtown STL is made of concrete and steel with Brutalist architecture that has lasted, on average 100+ years.


The first problem many people have with surviving in an urban area during an apocalypse is simple. Too. Many. Zombies. The tall, dense area of Downtown STL barely stretches a single mile, before becoming suburbs on the north side, factories on the south and west side, and completely abandoned, more murders-per-capita than El Salvador overgrown farms and forest in East St. Louis.


This yields a number of benefits.

1) Significant enough for helicopter evacuations, insignificant enough to not warrant a bombing

2) Arable dirt and farmland across the street in East St Louis, for taking back to create a rooftop garden in the instance of a very long-term outbreak, when your provisions run out (I have hundreds of cans stashed - Midwest apartments are massive)

3) Truckloads of guns in East St Louis, and a heavily militarized police force (think back to footage you saw of St Louis police during Ferguson protests) making the local populace more equipped for an outbreak.

4) Live 20 stories in the air, out-of-range of handguns and average raiders, with less risk of an out-of-control zombie outbreak from the density of a city like New York.


Here's additional things to consider:

1) Downtown St Louis is built to be abandoned at night. Office buildings+entertainment are the majority of the buildings, while high-zombie-risk structures, such as very dense apartments (the average apartment size here is 850sqft) or hospitals, are in the Central West End 10 miles away.

2) Our electric bill is $10/month. The building is heavily insulated, so we don't need to turn on the heater until the outside air drops into negative degrees Fahrenheit. When it is warm, the high-altitude winds keep our apartment cool when we open the windows. We use electricity for cooking+TV.

3) Significant natural light, but very few occupied high rises, meaning you can snipe out your windows with much less risk of alerting raiders that your apartment is occupied

4) Heavy, high-security doors with electronic exterior locks and manual indoor locks for high-crime area (locks can only be deactivated from the inside using manual controls during a power outage)

5) Survivors are constantly roving the countryside, with varying levels of desperation. The ground levels of downtown STL will be quickly looted, leaving little to attract raiders to this deadzone.

many modern apartment buildings are made with cheaper, yet less durable, wood and glass. downtown stl is made of concrete and steel with brutalist architecture that has lasted, on average 100+ years.


the first problem many people have with surviving in an urban area during an apocalypse is simple. too. many. zombies. the tall, dense area of downtown stl barely stretches a single mile, before becoming suburbs on the north side, factories on the south and west side, and completely abandoned, more murders-per-capita than el salvador overgrown farms and forest in east st. louis.


this yields a number of benefits.

1) significant enough for helicopter evacuations, insignificant enough to not warrant a bombing

2) arable dirt and farmland across the street in east st louis, for taking back to create a rooftop garden in the instance of a very long-term outbreak, when your provisions run out (i have hundreds of cans stashed - midwest apartments are massive)

3) truckloads of guns in east st louis, and a heavily militarized police force (think back to footage you saw of st louis police during ferguson protests) making the local populace more equipped for an outbreak.

4) live 20 stories in the air, out-of-range of handguns and average raiders, with less risk of an out-of-control zombie outbreak from the density of a city like new york.


here's additional things to consider:

1) downtown st louis is built to be abandoned at night. office buildings+entertainment are the majority of the buildings, while high-zombie-risk structures, such as very dense apartments (the average apartment size here is 850sqft) or hospitals, are in the central west end 10 miles away.

2) our electric bill is $10/month. the building is heavily insulated, so we don't need to turn on the heater until the outside air drops into negative degrees fahrenheit. when it is warm, the high-altitude winds keep our apartment cool when we open the windows. we use electricity for cooking+tv.

3) significant natural light, but very few occupied high rises, meaning you can snipe out your windows with much less risk of alerting raiders that your apartment is occupied

4) heavy, high-security doors with electronic exterior locks and manual indoor locks for high-crime area (locks can only be deactivated from the inside using manual controls during a power outage)

5) survivors are constantly roving the countryside, with varying levels of desperation. the ground levels of downtown stl will be quickly looted, leaving little to attract raiders to this deadzone. 


please prove me wrong! i put my thoughts out here to ask how i can further plan for an apocalypse-like event, not to brag about how far i've planned to this point."
Think fast! Zombies are on the way and will arrive at your current position in exactly 10 minutes. How do you prepare yourself?,"Currently I'm on a subway train with no weapon access nearby, so options limited. First I'm gonna try and establish where they are coming from and move as far down to the other end of the train as possible, warning people as I go, trying to reach a door. Soon as the train stops I'm pulling those open and getting the hell out of there because this train is a killbox now. While I'm moving I'd take the text books out of my bag and stuff them into the sleeves of my coat, wrapped around the arm. That way I at least have rudimentary forearm protection since the arms tend to be the primary grappling targets. There are fire extinguishers on the platforms, which is all I have in terms of weapons. Best I can hope to do is spray low to the ground in front of the zombies and try and make a slipping hazard- zombies aren't exactly agile after all. Could be used as a bludgeon in an emergency, but in all likelihood I'm probably screwed if I get into that position.

What would you do with your pets if there was a zombie apocalypse happening?,"Genuinely curious as to what everyone would do. I have 2 cats and 2 dogs.

An overlooked but obvious question …,"Everyone is all into survival, from tactics to products to planning. The need arises from the idea that humanity could face an almost immediate apocalypse at just about any time which will plunge us into a do or die situation. Be it from a zombie virus, some other pandemic, the collapse of our financial and public safety systems, a reversal of magnetic polarity, alien invasion, nuclear war, or Democrats taking completely control of the government, these things will pit us against neighbors for survival. 

Now, we all know of media forums for prepping. There is great energy expended on this subject. Plus, people are just way into this subject itself, on its own merits. And that’s fine. But as I peruse the variety of thought on many subjects related to survival theory and practice, I continuously find one thing missing. 

The one thing is this: Who are we going to fuck in the apocalypse?!? Nobody addresses the practical necessity of needing to bust a nut. If you have a wife or girlfriend who is alive when you need to bug out, then fine. But even then they may not survive long. What are you going to do then? Remain celibate? 

I think it’s clear, and admittedly unfortunate, that once we are well into our post-apocalyptic world women will necessarily become chattel to be possessed by the strong and powerful (for their personal use) and by pimps (for public use). It’s going to be like “Soylent Green”, in which you can rent an apartment that comes with “furniture”, I.e., a concubine. 

Now sir, a profiteering man with vision could really take advantage of this when the shit hits the fan by rounding up women and then holding them as a commodity. Pussy is going to be like gold in the post-apocalyptic world! Other holes may do in a pinch. But only warm, smooth, wet pussy can truly satisfy, and the real stuff cannot be duplicated. 

Therefore, I respectfully suggest that instead of debating tent materials and which MREs are best, your time will be much better spent on figuring out the pussy dilemma. And not only that, but you also have to plan for the Pussy Wars! Clearly there will be men who will use force attempting to raid your pussy stable. You must be strong, both to preserve your pussy holdings AND to be able to raid other pussy stables in order to increase product!!
The fact is that if you look at things the right way the apocalypse won’t have to be so bad.

Cooking,"You would probably be limited food wise in the apocalypse so what ‘meals’ could be cooked easily. I’m talking more about a few years into the zombie apocalypse as it is likely you will just be surviving off canned foods for the first 1 or 2 years.

Writing a Zombie Survival Horror Story,"This is heavily based off research and evaluation of different survival guides, things like CONPLAN 888, Max Brooks' books, the CDC prep guide, and things like it. That said, this story is pretty much going through the first few steps of those, in the approach of a single person, alone in their apartment, at the sudden onset of the apocalypse. How prepared or unprepared they might be to deal with those problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Feedback wanted! Gimme them hard critiques yo. Seriously, I made this a few days ago and I know it needs serious work. I felt like trying a first person narrative, with a present tense? I know I messed up on the tense occasionally, and that the language is garbo. This is just a very rough first draft to see if it flows correctly, and that I can at least somewhat reasonably convey my ideas across the page.

That said, please enjoy this hopefully tense first person zombie survival segment.

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Mia Roe. I was twenty-three years old when the world ended.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been living my own, as an American college student, for a few years now. I had a good position as a designer for a magazine, after getting a 2 year degree in graphic design. It wasn't much, but it was a good start to my career. I was even being considered for a promotion to a senior level position in the marketing department.

&amp;#x200B;

It was early April, still a little chilly, but with the warm sun outside. The sky was a clear and beautiful blue, and the sounds of life went by all around me in a dying midwestern city called Northland. I was out doing laundry at the local laundromat, just a few blocks away from my apartment, when I heard this loud bang.

&amp;#x200B;

It was like an explosion of some kind - over the hill up the street. I stood there, mouth agape, wide eyed, seeing everyone else freeze around me. The lights in the laundromat flickered and went out. Someone's car engine died mid start up. There was this breeze, this sudden gust of wind-

&amp;#x200B;

It carried with it a smell like burning metal, acrid and electrifying. The hairs on my neck stood on end. There was this sound - a faint sound at first, that I didn't want to recognize as screaming. A car roared over the hill and sped off into traffic. Brakes squealed, horns honked, everyone who had stood frozen lurched into action.

&amp;#x200B;

I shoved my laundry into the backseat of my car and ran over to the drivers side to start my engine. Everyone was fleeing, running away from, from whatever that sound was! By the time I pulled out and started heading down the road, I could see it was no use. I barely got within a blocks distance of my apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

Traffic was at a standstill, it was already total chaos. No one even knew what was going on. Just that loud boom, and now this. But the other sound, the quiet one... it was slowly growing louder. This terrible, wailing, moaning, screaming. And it wasn't just coming form behind me. It seemed to be coming from all over.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone had wrecked near the red light, and there was a pile up at the intersection. People were shouting and fighting to get away from the noise. My ears rang with the sound of horns and shouting. I figured I should ditch my car, and went back to grab my laundry. I don't know what I was thinking- it's just one of those things you automatically do without considering it.

&amp;#x200B;

With the basket in hand I was running down the block towards my apartment. Outside of my car, that sound, that screaming, was getting louder now, closing in on me. People were fighting now, around the parked cars, a total brawl had broken out. Descended into chaos and madness. I thought I...

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I saw someone bite someone else, and rip their throat out. I couldn't think about it. I could barely keep myself from screaming. I had to run. They were right behind me now, rushing down the hill towards the pile up, how many people? Dozens? A hundred? I couldn't stop to count.

&amp;#x200B;

I barreled into the door that opened on the main stairwell for my apartment building. I rushed up the flight of stairs to the landing on the second floor. The door banged shut behind me. I threw myself into my apartment, shutting the door behind me. Over the sound of my own breathing I could hear someone enter the stairwell.

&amp;#x200B;

I backed away from the door, staring at it in horror. Blind terror overcame me. Did someone see me come in? Were they following me? Footsteps rushed up the stairwell, and I instinctively reached to lock the door, pressing my paltry weight against it. It was a woman, who banged on my door, every door, screaming, asking for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't think less of me. I didn't know what was happening. Who was out there, what they were doing, what they wanted. Why there was that terrible sound of screaming outside my window. I didn't open the door. I just started crying silently, wishing she would go away.

&amp;#x200B;

I heard someone come in behind her. They were moaning and wailing, and she starting screaming and banging on the doors all over again. When she stopped, turning towards whatever had come in behind her, I...

&amp;#x200B;

I barricaded myself in. I pushed over a book case, using all my weight to leverage it, letting it fall against my couch and making a sort of triangle. They were fighting out there. I could hear her trying, struggling. I couldn't help her. I didn't even want to help her. I closed my eyes shut tight and tried not to listen.

&amp;#x200B;

She died out there. I am as certain of that now as I was then. The... thing, that had come in behind her. It just... it started eating her. There were these sounds, biting, chewing, slurping. I held my hand against my mouth to muffle the sobs. To muffle my screams. Eventually it started banging on my door, too.

&amp;#x200B;

It wanted in. It wanted to eat me. There was nothing I could do against this monster. I slunk away from my door and curled up, balling myself underneath my desk, holding my ears. It gave up eventually, I think. I could hear it fall down the stairs. Make it's way out the door. Towards the rest of the screaming.

&amp;#x200B;

By this point, there were the sounds of gunshots outside, in the city. I was wracked with pain and fear. Complete terror, total panic, the unwillingness to face what was out there, these horrible dark feelings washed over, consumed me. I heard her get up in the hallway. She started scratching at my door.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't take it anymore. I think I might have passed out for a minute there. It was all too much for me. Too insane to admit it was really happening. Mind you, I had no idea, what was really happening. If I pretended I didn't see what I saw - strips of flesh hanging from someone's jaw, their guts torn out, still walking towards me - if I could pretend it wasn't real...

&amp;#x200B;

If I could wake up from this nightmare. But it wasn't. I couldn't. This was real. My reality, turned upside down, a world of red and black all over. When I finally came to, it was still early in the evening, maybe only a couple of hours had passed. I felt thirsty. The shock of it all had wracked my body. There was no more sound in the hallway.

&amp;#x200B;

Things had quieted down outside, somewhat. They were still out there. Moaning, wailing, and screaming. The gunshots continued. Fires burned in the city. I could smell the death, the fear, but I couldn't let it wash over me. The time for panic was gone. I had to do something. I had to know something, anything, about what was out there.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved towards my window, to look outside. Fires burned in the courthouse. The car pile up was still there. There were... people, things, things that looked like people - eating each other, eating themselves. I gasped and backed away. I could feel the tears streaming down my face, my hand clamped over my mouth. What is this? What's happening? This is hell. This is... some sort of terrorist attack, or something. the government will be here.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to turn on the TV, but no luck. Were the breakers out? I vaguely remembered - the power had gone out at the laundromat just up the street, too. So then, the power was out to the surrounding area? I turned my phone on and tried plugging it in. No juice. No electricity. This is bad. But it won't last. What does the news say?

&amp;#x200B;

A life feed on YouTube. Someone bouncing around on the street, just outside. I can even see my own apartment building in the background.

&amp;#x200B;

""Holy shit, holy shit dude... what the hell is going on around here?"" Someone as lost and confused as I am. ""Some sort of riot has broken out, with these- these freaks, eating each other."" They turn the camera towards them, some guy, maybe ten years older than I am. Just as scared as I am. He looks like he's hiding in an alleyway, looking out on the street.

&amp;#x200B;

""I don't know what the fuck is going on here... the cops were, the cops were eaten! Some of them are still out there, I guess, but I saw a few get in their cars and run away. There was a police station near here, and a sherriff's office... where the hell are they?"" There wass a noise- some sort of rustling, and one of those moans, just behind him. He got spooked and moved along, going into a different alley. He moved across the street so fast. I hoped none of them noticed him...

&amp;#x200B;

""All right, so, it looks like traffic is out... I can't get to my car, so... I gotta try to get out of here. Stay with me, YouTube. Gotta be strong in times like this..."" I could see the chat moving past. most of them can't believe this dude. They say it's a hoax, or a movie shoot, or something. I almost wanted to reach out to him. To help.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I heard her get up in the hallway. With that low, quiet groan, in the back of her throat- slowly getting louder and louder, until it's a screeching, ear piercing wail. She scratches and pounds at my door, trying to get in. I can't just pretend not to hear her. To quiver and cry and scream to myself to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I put my headphones in and listen. The man, the other survivor, had moved a few streets down now. Where was he going? What was out there? Could he find some safety, some help? Would they find me, and help me too? All I could do was wonder with my eyes glued to the screen.

&amp;#x200B;

""All right YouTube, I've made it almost to the edge of the highway now. It looks like a lot of folks out there are dead and gone, some as back in town... what the hell is happening out there? I can't stop to look anything up. I gotta keep moving. This can't be real, right?""

&amp;#x200B;

He walks through a field I recognize, out by the old drive-in theater. Near the highway that heads North out of town. The suburbs around him are crawling with... them. As he rounds a corner, he sees a woman on the ground, struggling against her attacker. He shouts something, and goes up to help her.

&amp;#x200B;

He dropped his camera. I watch, maybe with the whole world, as he struggles to get the attacker off her. They tussle for a minute, struggling to grab hold. It reaches forward, trying to bite him. They leave frame for a second, and the man comes back in. I don't know what he did to shake the attacker off him. He reaches down for the woman, trying to help her.

&amp;#x200B;

She leans up and bites him. Right there on camera, tears into his shoulder. Blood is everywhere. He's screaming. I can't bare to watch anymore. My eyes hurt from crying. When I take the headphones out, I can still hear the woman in the hallway, scratching at my door. The low growling in her throat. The hungry growling.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate her for it. I know, it's irrational. I don't hate them anymore, but back then... why did she have to follow me? Why did she think I could help her? Why did I have to confront this, this demon, this knowledge, of a world gone mad? How could I live with that? How could I live, knowing...

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about it a lot back then. Suicide. Taking my own life. I wanted desperately to believe there was an end to this nightmare. That there was something, some way, I could save myself from it. I thought about it so many times. But my will to hang on was stronger. You never know just how much you can take, what you're willing to go through. I'd had suicidal thoughts before. I had been depressed. And knowing this, knowing the way the world was, I could still go on. I could go on knowing...

&amp;#x200B;

A few hours passed. I sat idly in my room. I tried to draw something, anything. I was losing it. Someone will come rescue me soon, I thought. That's what kept me going. Trying to pretend everything would be okay again. The live feeds were cut out. Information circulated. I had heard, headphones to my radio, that help was coming. I just had to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

I waited a few hours. And then a few days. When it seemed like help was no longer coming, when I heard that a week might pass, maybe two or three, before anyone- anyone at all, not the military, not the police- \*no one\* was coming. Well, I figured I might as well wait it out. Just wait and see, I told my self. Hang on and try to survive. A little bit longer.

&amp;#x200B;

I passed the first twelve or twenty four hours doing almost nothing. I had heard that there were checkpoints or safezones or quarantines being set up, just get to them. Either that, or wait inside. I opted for the latter. The anxiety was almost overwhelming. I took some of my medication, to try to help me sleep better. The first few days passed without a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I walked around my house like, well, a zombie. My mind was foggy and uncertain. Instead of panicking, I had nearly shut down completely. The scratching at my door, the constant moaning- it had become almost natural to me. Just this slight annoyance, I could almost pretend it didn't exist. You would be surprised, what the human brain can make seem normal.

&amp;#x200B;

After three days had passed, I felt a different kind of anxious. I still wasn't ready to admit no one was coming - but I was ready to admit that if they did, I should prepare to get the hell out of here. I started out reading up on what I should do in case of an emergency like this one - natural disaster, terrorist attack, any kind of emergency plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the electricity was out, I ran a bathtub full of water, fished some old bottles out of the trash can, ate whatever I could that hadn't spoiled in the fridge. I filled up anything I could find with water. This would be the most essential element, the first thing that would be ready to go. I needed this to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I decided I should take stock of my supplies. My town experienced black outs in bad storm weather, so I had a couple flashlights, batteries, candles, lighters, matches. I had a bunch of canned vegetables and fruits that I had always meant to get around to eating. I had to calculate what clothes I would need carefully. If I was going to be here a while, well... a single pair of jeans, underwear, shirt, jacket. Socks and shoes...

&amp;#x200B;

I had some hiking boots, with a steel toe and water proof. And I had my sneakers, too. Finally, I had plenty of books, games, and movies or shows, to keep my company. The books would be useful. With the power still out, I had to conserve my phone battery. I started checking it only once per day, whenever I was ready. The rest of the time I had to rely for news on the radio, for which I still had some batteries.

&amp;#x200B;

I could wait here for a while. If I ate three cans a day, maybe a couple weeks, at most. Past that... no. Someone would be here. Someone would come and get me. I just had to conserve my food, my water, my energy, my sanity. I just had to wait for rescue...

&amp;#x200B;

End of part one! You might notice some things like the paragraphs being pretty short, that there's a lack of dialogue, a couple other seemingly odd or out of place stylistic choices. This is just because I was studying things like light novels at the time and how they're written, to see if I could get the same kind of weirdly compelling yet choppy narrative flow. I was also trying the sort of incidental flow of consciousness that comes from these kinds of stories.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason, that comes really easy to me, so I somehow managed to write five continuing pieces from this - all over them just have the one character? I don't know if that makes it more compelling from a  survivalist perspective, or more boring from a narrative perspective? Either way, if you managed to read this whole thing, or just skipped to the bottom, please let me know if you liked it, if you'd want to read more, if you think I should have more than character, if you think I should burn it with fire, or go over it for three more first drafts, or if I even managed to cobble together these Frankenstein elements of storytelling into a single compelling piece of narrative.

&amp;#x200b;

""holy shit, holy shit dude... what the hell is going on around here?"" someone as lost and confused as i am. ""some sort of riot has broken out, with these- these freaks, eating each other."" they turn the camera towards them, some guy, maybe ten years older than i am. just as scared as i am. he looks like he's hiding in an alleyway, looking out on the street.

&amp;#x200b;

""i don't know what the fuck is going on here... the cops were, the cops were eaten! some of them are still out there, i guess, but i saw a few get in their cars and run away. there was a police station near here, and a sherriff's office... where the hell are they?"" there wass a noise- some sort of rustling, and one of those moans, just behind him. he got spooked and moved along, going into a different alley. he moved across the street so fast. i hoped none of them noticed him...

&amp;#x200b;

""all right, so, it looks like traffic is out... i can't get to my car, so... i gotta try to get out of here. stay with me, youtube. gotta be strong in times like this..."" i could see the chat moving past. most of them can't believe this dude. they say it's a hoax, or a movie shoot, or something. i almost wanted to reach out to him. to help.

&amp;#x200b;

that's when i heard her get up in the hallway. with that low, quiet groan, in the back of her throat- slowly getting louder and louder, until it's a screeching, ear piercing wail. she scratches and pounds at my door, trying to get in. i can't just pretend not to hear her. to quiver and cry and scream to myself to sleep.

&amp;#x200b;

i put my headphones in and listen. the man, the other survivor, had moved a few streets down now. where was he going? what was out there? could he find some safety, some help? would they find me, and help me too? all i could do was wonder with my eyes glued to the screen.

&amp;#x200b;

""all right youtube, i've made it almost to the edge of the highway now. it looks like a lot of folks out there are dead and gone, some as back in town... what the hell is happening out there? i can't stop to look anything up. i gotta keep moving. this can't be real, right?""

&amp;#x200b;

he walks through a field i recognize, out by the old drive-in theater. near the highway that heads north out of town. the suburbs around him are crawling with... them. as he rounds a corner, he sees a woman on the ground, struggling against her attacker. he shouts something, and goes up to help her.

&amp;#x200b;

he dropped his camera. i watch, maybe with the whole world, as he struggles to get the attacker off her. they tussle for a minute, struggling to grab hold. it reaches forward, trying to bite him. they leave frame for a second, and the man comes back in. i don't know what he did to shake the attacker off him. he reaches down for the woman, trying to help her.

&amp;#x200b;

she leans up and bites him. right there on camera, tears into his shoulder. blood is everywhere. he's screaming. i can't bare to watch anymore. my eyes hurt from crying. when i take the headphones out, i can still hear the woman in the hallway, scratching at my door. the low growling in her throat. the hungry growling.

&amp;#x200b;

i hate her for it. i know, it's irrational. i don't hate them anymore, but back then... why did she have to follow me? why did she think i could help her? why did i have to confront this, this demon, this knowledge, of a world gone mad? how could i live with that? how could i live, knowing...

&amp;#x200b;

i thought about it a lot back then. suicide. taking my own life. i wanted desperately to believe there was an end to this nightmare. that there was something, some way, i could save myself from it. i thought about it so many times. but my will to hang on was stronger. you never know just how much you can take, what you're willing to go through. i'd had suicidal thoughts before. i had been depressed. and knowing this, knowing the way the world was, i could still go on. i could go on knowing...

&amp;#x200b;

a few hours passed. i sat idly in my room. i tried to draw something, anything. i was losing it. someone will come rescue me soon, i thought. that's what kept me going. trying to pretend everything would be okay again. the live feeds were cut out. information circulated. i had heard, headphones to my radio, that help was coming. i just had to wait.

&amp;#x200b;

i waited a few hours. and then a few days. when it seemed like help was no longer coming, when i heard that a week might pass, maybe two or three, before anyone- anyone at all, not the military, not the police- \*no one\* was coming. well, i figured i might as well wait it out. just wait and see, i told my self. hang on and try to survive. a little bit longer.

&amp;#x200b;

i passed the first twelve or twenty four hours doing almost nothing. i had heard that there were checkpoints or safezones or quarantines being set up, just get to them. either that, or wait inside. i opted for the latter. the anxiety was almost overwhelming. i took some of my medication, to try to help me sleep better. the first few days passed without a problem.

&amp;#x200b;

i walked around my house like, well, a zombie. my mind was foggy and uncertain. instead of panicking, i had nearly shut down completely. the scratching at my door, the constant moaning- it had become almost natural to me. just this slight annoyance, i could almost pretend it didn't exist. you would be surprised, what the human brain can make seem normal.

&amp;#x200b;

after three days had passed, i felt a different kind of anxious. i still wasn't ready to admit no one was coming - but i was ready to admit that if they did, i should prepare to get the hell out of here. i started out reading up on what i should do in case of an emergency like this one - natural disaster, terrorist attack, any kind of emergency plan.

&amp;#x200b;

since the electricity was out, i ran a bathtub full of water, fished some old bottles out of the trash can, ate whatever i could that hadn't spoiled in the fridge. i filled up anything i could find with water. this would be the most essential element, the first thing that would be ready to go. i needed this to survive.

&amp;#x200b;

next i decided i should take stock of my supplies. my town experienced black outs in bad storm weather, so i had a couple flashlights, batteries, candles, lighters, matches. i had a bunch of canned vegetables and fruits that i had always meant to get around to eating. i had to calculate what clothes i would need carefully. if i was going to be here a while, well... a single pair of jeans, underwear, shirt, jacket. socks and shoes...

&amp;#x200b;

i had some hiking boots, with a steel toe and water proof. and i had my sneakers, too. finally, i had plenty of books, games, and movies or shows, to keep my company. the books would be useful. with the power still out, i had to conserve my phone battery. i started checking it only once per day, whenever i was ready. the rest of the time i had to rely for news on the radio, for which i still had some batteries.

&amp;#x200b;

i could wait here for a while. if i ate three cans a day, maybe a couple weeks, at most. past that... no. someone would be here. someone would come and get me. i just had to conserve my food, my water, my energy, my sanity. i just had to wait for rescue...

&amp;#x200b;

end of part one! you might notice some things like the paragraphs being pretty short, that there's a lack of dialogue, a couple other seemingly odd or out of place stylistic choices. this is just because i was studying things like light novels at the time and how they're written, to see if i could get the same kind of weirdly compelling yet choppy narrative flow. i was also trying the sort of incidental flow of consciousness that comes from these kinds of stories.

&amp;#x200b;

for some reason, that comes really easy to me, so i somehow managed to write five continuing pieces from this - all over them just have the one character? i don't know if that makes it more compelling from a  survivalist perspective, or more boring from a narrative perspective? either way, if you managed to read this whole thing, or just skipped to the bottom, please let me know if you liked it, if you'd want to read more, if you think i should have more than character, if you think i should burn it with fire, or go over it for three more first drafts, or if i even managed to cobble together these frankenstein elements of storytelling into a single compelling piece of narrative. thanks and much apprec, dl delaney."

Weighing In on the Issue of Bug-Out Bags,"I have seen a lot of people talk about bug-out bags, and their gear, and I always wonder if people are taking into account how much all of that equipment weights and how able they would be to carry it.

What regions would be overrun first?,"In my opinion, any place with a higher density of population and lower medical aid would fall quickly. Climate would matter as well because how fast the infections spread depend on it.


Countries With high population densities (If you're here, you're basically fucked ig) :


Monaco - 19,361/km²
Singapore - 8,019/km²
Bahrain - 2,182/km²
Maldives - 1,802/km²
Malta - 1,642/km²
Bangladesh - 1,265/km²
Vatican City - 924/km²
Barbados - 668/km²
Lebanon - 667/km²
Mauritius - 624/km²


US has medical aid and Canada has very less density of population so both of these have a strong survival chance. Russia falls in the same category; low population density and high med supplies. China would probably be the country in which the infections started jk. About Japan I'm not so sure.

Europe is relatively fucked considering the wet climate and seeing how they handled the covid crisis.

Desert regions are as always a place which you would go to but surviving there long term isn't a practical idea (for most people)

Half of Africa is undersupplied in medical sector and some of them already have higher deaths even without any apocalypse (mainly because of hunger and malnutrition). So i don't think the Saharan and half of Africa would go far. South Africa has great medical care, and has great sea accessibility, so it has a chance (if the dead from its neighbouring countries don't fuck them up first)

Best tactics in my setting against the undead. Looking for feedback/questions/comments.,"The year is 2100, since 2029 the undead have been the dominant species on earth. Humans are rare, while a few scavengers wander the wasteland, most are only able to remain alive by hiding in places the dead cannot reach. 

Some humans exist in the mountains and tundra where the climate keeps the dead away. Others survive in large ships and submarines, only going near the land when they need to. Others exist in massive, advanced cities, which maintain technology and populations required to keep the undead away. Though some need to fight the undead more than others, all humans are at risk, and require militarized forces to deal with undead.

The undead outnumber humans, and unlike humans all of them are able to have 100% of their population combat ready. There are many types, from grand liches to lowly walkers, however all of them share the train of regeneration. While undead are in a state of constant rot, they're also in a state of constant healing. Any damage the undead take will eventually be healed, and things like bullet wounds can be healed from much faster, and veins can be pretty quickly mended. However, the destruction of the head or heart will mean death for any undead, and something like a limb can't be regrown quickly. 

Humans main weapon for the past 500 years; firearms, are mostly useless against the undead. It's unlikely most guns will be able to neutralize the dead for more than a few seconds with the average shot. Guns are also a complex technology, that most in the mountains won't have, and most in the cities and ships won't want to waste that much led. Undead are however much more badly damaged by cuts, a decapitation will kill one, and the removal of a limb will be serious damage. Because of this, most humans fighting the undead employ blades as their primary weapons, with guns only being carried in the anticipation of human threats.

The undead also pose a problem due to their infectious nature. A single bite can turn someone and will likely do so far too quickly to try to put the victim down before they turn. Thus, most humans in territory with a risk of undead wear extensive armor. Wrist, leg and head armor is always worn in undead territory (and even commonly worn by many in safe areas), and full plate armor is worn by any warriors who can afford it. While the undead are capable of wielding any weapons they find, so even in plate no human is safe, it's far better to die to their clubs and maces then to be bitten and turned.

Beyond that, humans must always deal with their largest disadvantage, numbers. For a human warrior's death to not be a net loss for humanity, they'd have to have ended the lives of at least fifty undead. Not only are humans outnumbered, but most of them have jobs other than killing the undead. Because of this, there would be no point to meeting the undead on an open field, if humans were ever to engage with the hoard head on it would be a terrible loss for humankind. Humans have to use stealth and strategy, finding where the undead go to rest and picking them off from there, finding smaller groups and isolating them to attack, or throwing grenades at groups of undead from safe areas are all popular tactics. 

Cities tend to send out rangers, small squads of elite warriors that can often be more effective than larger armies. They go deep into undead territory, not just to kill undead but also to set up defenses, scout out new important areas, study the area and the dead, and claim land before other humans do. Rangers aren't expected to kill the undead unless attacked, given an advantage, or they have a very specific target to take out. 

Colonies are important to most humans. Especially those living in the cities or ships who need colonies for mines and farms. Because of this colonial defense has become a big part of how humans fight the undead. This is one of the worst ways humans will engage with the dead, as if a colony is attacked it's not on the humans' terms. Walls are built that the dead need to siege, and hundreds of men can be mobilized to the area to defend it. Traps and difficult terrain are built around colonies so that the undead will have trouble navigating the area. Colonies are also built so that the undead will never be able to utilize their numbers during an attack. And if worse comes to worse, most colonies have some sort of explosive under them that would allow the area to be destroyed if all hope was lost.

Possibly the worst thing of all is that humanity seems to be winning. Groups of humans ally with each other less and less. And undead seem to be afraid of human at this point. Groups of rangers, such as the terminous of New York or the Greycore of LA have been encountering undead less and less every year, and human enemies more and more. Many young rangers are quite disturbed when they learn that the wastelands of the 22nd century aren't the same as the wastelands that their fathers and grandfathers fought in when they're expected to use their weapons against their fellow humans on their missions.

What will be the frequency of human conflict in a zombie apocalypse?,"I recently had a long discussion with someone else on this sub that believed that the majority of people would form raiding parties and attack other groups for supplies.

However, I believe the opposite would happen and that the majority of people will likely learn to farm the land, become self-sufficient and trade with other communities. I do think that there will be some human conflict but it would be fairly infrequent compared to what is generally depicted in the media.

Would it be easier to survive an outbreak now vs the 1980s?,"I would think that ultimately it would be better to live through a zombie apocalypse in the 2020's rather than the 80's, as internet usage is more widespread and technology is much better these days in general. 

While trying to think if the 80s had anything going for it, I came up with:

- World population in 1985: 4.8 billion (7.9 billion 2021). I would assume this translates to a lot less undead roaming around. The amount of ammo you have then would get you a lot further than it would now.

- Less development: More instances of rural or hard-to-reach places where roads and public transit have yet to reach. Wider distances between cities would make them more defensible.

- (US) Relaxed gun culture. Up until the mid 90's it wasn't unusual for high school students in some states to bring guns to school so that they could go hunting afterwards. Compared to modern times, this would give some schools a fighting chance in the 80s.

- Offline navigation: I just remember maps being a huge thing decades ago and every gas station would be stuffed with maps of the area and popular destinations. Cars would be filled with them too. I don't believe most of us these days wouldn't readily have access to these things anymore. They'd be harder to find in 2021 and invaluable if you can no longer power electronics.

So, my logic is kind of along these lines. If the winter freezes zombies, you take some time killing zombies to reduce the number in your area come winter. Preparing for this would probably be time consuming, don’t know what to expect and all. You could spend time building or doing noisy projects. The biggest thing for me, is obviously the cold.

The four types of survivor lifestyles in the age on the undead. Looking for questions/comments/feedback.,"Note: this is specifically for a worldbuilding project I'm working on, in case it wasn't clear.

Around the year 2030 the undead first overtook humanity, with almost the entire population of earth destroyed by the swarm, with the politicians and militaries at the time being too focused on killing each other to protect themselves from the undead. 

However, some humans in specific circumstances were able to survive, utilizing geography and technology to create defenses against the undead. Four distinct types of survivors exist after nearly a century of the undead's reign, each type appearing in multiple isolated parts of the world where specific conditions allow them to survive.

***The four types of human survivors***

Scavengers: probably the first type that comes to mind when you hear the phrase ""undead survivor"". These are small isolated groups of people whose ancestors were able to evade the undead early on. They maintain the most from their pre-apocalypse culture, wearing rags of ancient clothing and living in ruins of the old society. They live directly in undead territory, usually outnumbered upwards fifteen to one, though at this point closer to thirty to one. They have no permanent way of surviving, scavenging and hunting for food, fighting undead every day, and going from place to place, and rarely traveling in groups larger then a few dozen. They have no good relations with other peoples, the three other groups cannot trade with them for anything but slaves, and often consider them to be nothing more but future undead, and exterminate them as they would the lesser undead. It's likely they will die out some day.

Storm people: often called mountain people, but able to exist in tundra and jungles in the way, the storm people are those who are able to survive by living in places that have a extreme tactical advantage against the undead, such as mountains like the Appalachians, Balkans or Rockys, as well as other harsh locations such as the Amazon, Northern Canada, or the Australian Bush. While they still have to defend against undead, they have enough of an advantage against them to stake out their territory and create permanent settlements. However, they've lost the industrialized society of the old world, devolving into a technological level most comparable to the iron age, with firearms and a few other technologies being the only modern things they use (and in some areas not even that). However, they can survive, and with stone walls and fortresses they can live without constant fear of the dead, often even attacking them. Most of their societies have become very conservative and isolationist, often being structured into fiefdoms or tribes. While they're seen as barbarians to the other groups of humans, they still can trade and make alliances with them, as they have valuable raw materials and farming, and a population capable of actively combating both humans and undead.

Tech people: the decedents of the most advanced and populated regions of the world, those protected most by the powers of the old world when the dead first attacked, and surviving using military power and advanced technology. They exist in the cultural centers of the old world such as New York, Los Anglos, Hong Kong, Israel, and other such places. Everything within their societies is based around technology, with most of them surpassing their pre-apocalypse counterparts, genetic engineering is required for their food, massive wind turbines and water turbines generating their power. Groups in almost every civilization of tech people have used their technology to change themselves to be something other then human, with surgery, chemicals and machinery replacing the functions of the normal human form. While most of these people live the best materially, with modern luxuries available to them and massive armies defending them from the undead, they're also the most unnatural societies on earth, with high crime rates, extreme degeneracy, and factions within them fighting each other. They also almost all have extreme and brutal warriors cultures, and expansionist politics that put them in conflict with other humans as much as they do the undead in their land grabs. 

Sea people: the Vikings of the apocalypse. The sea people survived on large ships and submarines, allowing them to completely ignore the undead if they want to, their only battles against the undead being when they want to clear islands for colonies, ports and vassals. They scour the open ocean, with clan based politics existing between individual vassals and fleets. Their technology is greater then the storm people, but lesser then the tech people. They trade with the other human groups for recourses, but they often raid them when trade is a worse option, their warships and submarines being useful for attacking their targets. The average sea person would be likely to only know land if they're raiding tech and storm people, or if they need to dock on an island for repairs. While they can be brutal against the people living on land, and rarely do anything against the undead, their trade has brought many far off groups of humans together.

What are your thoughts on these groups of people, I'd love to hear any feedback, comments and questions you may have. Are these groups plausible? What would you like to know more about?

How Far Would Your Resources Go In Terms of Zombie Prep?,"In a traditional Zombie Apocalypse situation, there is likely going to be a bit of lead time between when the rumors start and the first clips hit social media, and when things go to hell.  After all, zombies are only de-stabilizing to the population at large when there are significant numbers and not a lot of uninfected humans left to defend against them.  That first day when one person bites four more before ending up dead or confined, and then they infect four more people each before half of that number is stopped, and so on and so on, while they are growing exponentially, it could be a matter of days or weeks before it stops being rumor and starts being an emergency for a lot of people, and during those day banks and stores will be open, Amazon is going to be making deliveries, etc.

Lets say you're one of the lucky few, who sees the clip or the event day 1, and you KNOW it's coming while the rest of the world does not.  If you had 1 week, and all of your current resources at your disposal, how well would you be able to set yourself up? 

Think of your resources as your current belongings, the money you have in the bank or other accounts you could access reasonably quickly, maybe a work vehicle or tools which, while they don't belong to you, will be in your possession most of the time.

Personally, I don't have a huge problem with them, but 1) they're getting quite spammy, 2) they're low-effort, and 3) shit like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZombieSurvivalTactics/comments/qjzk0j/i\_took\_another\_shot\_at\_this\_i\_tried\_to\_keep\_it/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZombieSurvivalTactics/comments/qjdo0p/gotta\_stay\_hydrated) are just absurd. Additionally, there are a number of realism problems with them. While they can be entertaining, they don't accurately reflect a real-world situation. Granted, neither do Zombies themselves, but it is (I hope) understood that while we suspend those realism problems for the sake of presenting the situation, further suspension of realism detracts from overall discussion. That is to say, we have agreed upon a shared, ""reality,"" and deviating from that can make communication difficult.

That said, I'm not going to ban them outright. They're closer to a meme, so you will still be able to post them on Fridays. If someone wants to post a kit for discussion or critique, they are encouraged to do so in a more useful format, including but not limited to, a detailed list, links to specific products, detailed photographs, or real world pack organization programs like lighterpack.com. These may not be as aesthetically pleasing as the system in question, But it is much more accurate to the real world.

***

Finally, a note on mod communication. In the future, please don't call the mods out in a post. There are established communication methods for that (reporting posts, messaging the mods, the chat function if all else fails). Calling us out in a public post does little more than make whoever posted the target of contradicting opinions and makes any decision we come to automatically more divisive. If we agree with you, we look like we're picking favorites. If we don't, it looks like we are succumbing to popular opinion (as responses on a divisive post of any kind tend to skew toward disagreement). By calling us out publicly, you lessen our ability to effectively moderate the content you have a problem with.

Something Ive never seen suggested: Person-drawn gypsy wagon.,"When people think of gypsies, they imagine the large wagons big enough for a family drawn by horses, but there were also ones that were small/light enough to be pulled by only a single person. With a properly maintained axle and balanced weight load, a single person can pull a surprising amount of weight.

The wagon would be just big enough for a single person to sleep on the floor, with tons of shelves for storage space up the walls to be a traveling merchant or to just live in as a single bachelor. I feel like this would be awesome in a zombie apocalypse, especially if you put a turret mounted on top. Come across a group of zombies? Climb on the roof and either shoot them, or just hide up there until they pass by. Install a shutter on the side with some pull out shelving and you could easily set up as a traveling merchant.

However, some humans survived, nearly 70 years after the end three types of human settlements survive, those who survived in massive fortified cities, those who've survived on boats, and those who've survived in the mountains. Of these, those living in urban strongholds are the most populace and technologically advanced, though also those who require the most adaptation to survive.

I'll be specifically focused on the urban stronghold imperium here (because it's the one I know the most about), as it's easiest to use one society as an example, but many of these issues and solutions apply to other cities. Imperium is one of the last strongholds of North America, being a combination of New York City and surrounding areas. 

The main issue that every stronghold has to deal with is food. As the undead by be kept at bay, the land the dead hold is the land that would be providing food for a normal civilization. The majority of food produced in imperium is via aquaculture, with advances is genetic engineering allowing for massive underwater farms to exist beneath the rivers surrounding the city. While most of the food of the city is produced through aquaculture, recent efforts have allowed the recolonization of fertile land, allowing plant based food and red meats to be sold to the nobility and merchant classes as luxury goods.

Secondary to food are hard recourses. While in early days scavenging could be used for plastic and metal, recycling discarded goods has mostly replaced the need to scavenge. Colonies of mines have begun to spring up, though unlike most other cities imperium has anti-slavery laws that prevent these mines from becoming a preferable alternative. However, there is still one metal unobtainable without recycling within North America; copper, this metal can only be gotten through scavenging and recycling due to a lack of deposits in North America, and has thus been used as a currency, and the basis of the imperial economy.

Defense against the undead is of course another major issue, though in recent years its become less of a problem in the center of the city. Soldiers, especially from Houses such as Teminous and Incubous, have become the main physical force, with units of rangers heading out into the wasteland to hunt the undead. Swords have become the main anti undead weapon due to the undead ability to survive most bullet wounds (as well as a lack of ammo on humanity's part). However, the true defense against the undead is fortifications, walls and rivers. As more colonies are built the undead are pushed further and further back, far off colonies filled with surfs often being considered canaries in the coalmine for an approaching swarm of the dead. Of course, as mankind wins the war against the dead, many now consider other humans to be the main threat.

Another issue is the issue of maintaining a modern standard of living within the city walls. Internet requires underground wires and radio signals to function, and electricity requires nuclear plants deep below the earth. While it is a political question as to weather maintaining the old way of life is a major questions, with houses such as Bard and Elise fighting to create a world with the living standards of the old world, while houses such as Quezal and Teminous trying to best use what humanity has to finally destroy the hoard.

Even weather or not humanity should remain fully human is a question. Androids were experimented with early on, but after issues with them they've been banished to a small reservation in New Jersey. However, with biological and biomechanical technology advancing, houses such as Valyryn and Incubous have began to change human bodies to become creatures that are not fully human anymore inorder to better survive in this new world.

What are your thoughts? Is this plausible? Is there anything you'd like to know more about?

Is this scenario plausible for a zombie apocalypse? Looking for questions and feedback.,"Hey, one of my worlds in a zombie apocalypse setting, and I've been wondering how plausible the scenario for survival and the fall is? It's a lot different from most other scenarios, so It'll be interesting to see peoples' thought on it.

Some time in the early to middle 21st century, an outbreak begins of undead. It's like no other outbreak in earth's history, seeming synthetic in design, but more advanced then anything humans at the time would be capable of. The outbreak mutates people into several different forms of undead creatures, creating a caste system of undead, though many are shambling husks of their former selves, the higher castes retain some of their human intellect, and their behaviors allow for coordination and strategy. Because of this, the infection is closer to an oncoming army then a normal pandemic.

The first cases begin in central Eurasia, and quickly similar cases are reported in west Africa and eventually the plague spreads to Australia and eventually the American Midwest. For the first few months the plague isn't seen as the main issue of the world, with governments being caught up with warfare in Iran. Forces are only truly diverted to deal with the pandemic after the city of Winnipeg is reported to have been consumed by undead.

Though much of the fighting is too little too late. Many people flee from the countryside to large cities, with hope of safety in numbers. The military attempts to protect the cities, but only a few last the first wave. 

Eventually only a few cities remain. In America New York and LA, both defended by geography and the two largest population centers, end up as the last two America cities on the planet. The American Military was also able to protect much of their recently invaded land in Iran. The Russian army was able to keep St. Petersburg from falling, and the British army was able to defend Glasgow (plans to protect London didn't go as well as planned). The Israeli army, due to their country's small size was able to protect their entire nation. Local forces in Hong Kong were also able to defend their city. International efforts attempted to keep many large cities, but in the long run the only cities protected by the UN were Rome, Capetown and Rio.

More peoples did survive in other smaller ways. Many people on Islands or ships were unaffected by the outbreak due to geography, surviving and eventually forming an interconnected society in the pacific, eventually going out to trade with, and sometimes raid, the cities. There were also many people able to survive on their own, retreating to the mountains, they returned to a tribal way of life, and existed in small semi nomadic communities from the Appalachians to the Balkans.  

As time passed the cities needed to expands, creating colonies throughout their surrounding areas. Farmland, mines, and defensive barriers were needed to sustain their massive populations. Though some things, such as aquaculture and recycling could be used to make these less needed, the top priority became to take land away from the undead.

Is this scenario plausible? I'd love to see your feedback and/or questions.",1,1631214994,NYC_hydra,36,1,True,2021-09-09,"is this scenario plausible for a zombie apocalypse? looking for questions and feedback. hey, one of my worlds in a zombie apocalypse setting, and i've been wondering how plausible the scenario for survival and the fall is? it's a lot different from most other scenarios, so it'll be interesting to see peoples' thought on it.

some time in the early to middle 21st century, an outbreak begins of undead. it's like no other outbreak in earth's history, seeming synthetic in design, but more advanced then anything humans at the time would be capable of. the outbreak mutates people into several different forms of undead creatures, creating a caste system of undead, though many are shambling husks of their former selves, the higher castes retain some of their human intellect, and their behaviors allow for coordination and strategy. because of this, the infection is closer to an oncoming army then a normal pandemic.

the first cases begin in central eurasia, and quickly similar cases are reported in west africa and eventually the plague spreads to australia and eventually the american midwest. for the first few months the plague isn't seen as the main issue of the world, with governments being caught up with warfare in iran. forces are only truly diverted to deal with the pandemic after the city of winnipeg is reported to have been consumed by undead.

though much of the fighting is too little too late. many people flee from the countryside to large cities, with hope of safety in numbers. the military attempts to protect the cities, but only a few last the first wave. 

eventually only a few cities remain. in america new york and la, both defended by geography and the two largest population centers, end up as the last two america cities on the planet. the american military was also able to protect much of their recently invaded land in iran. the russian army was able to keep st. petersburg from falling, and the british army was able to defend glasgow (plans to protect london didn't go as well as planned). the israeli army, due to their country's small size was able to protect their entire nation. local forces in hong kong were also able to defend their city. international efforts attempted to keep many large cities, but in the long run the only cities protected by the un were rome, capetown and rio.

more peoples did survive in other smaller ways. many people on islands or ships were unaffected by the outbreak due to geography, surviving and eventually forming an interconnected society in the pacific, eventually going out to trade with, and sometimes raid, the cities. there were also many people able to survive on their own, retreating to the mountains, they returned to a tribal way of life, and existed in small semi nomadic communities from the appalachians to the balkans.  

as time passed the cities needed to expands, creating colonies throughout their surrounding areas. farmland, mines, and defensive barriers were needed to sustain their massive populations. though some things, such as aquaculture and recycling could be used to make these less needed, the top priority became to take land away from the undead. frontiers and colonies were quickly created as the lifeblood of each city state.

however, the rulers of the city states being quickly set up military dictatorships, with the only purpose being to fight off the dead, gave them low approval rates among the people, especially those born into the apocalypse. because of this, new ideologies were formed to justify the state of the world. in la, the tech giants who maintained their quality of life became revered, and eventually treated as gods. in glasgow and st,peatersburg the idea that the dead must be slain became the ideology, unifying the two cities into one empire hellbent on destroying the dead.

How I would prepare for a zombie apocalypse,"Step 1: Prior to the apocalypse, secure adequate firearms, and ammo, along with other weapons

I would take a Dragunov SVD DMR and some AK knockoff. WASR-10s are affordable, common, and easy to use. It is important, though, to secure weapons that fit your style of fighting. Securing adequate amounts of ammo will be difficult due to the ammo bans imposed by the US Government. This coupled with the high demand for ammo will make your situation difficult. I will also be very careful to ensure that I acquire multiple forms of melee weapons(machetes, knives, etc.) because there's no telling when you run out of ammo. 

Step 2: Secure other necessary commodities

Remember: Although addiction is bad, it might be helpful to bring drugs(steroids, etc.) for last-ditch survival purposes. Aquire non-perishable food sources and water, of course, because you NEED food and water to survive. Acquire some form of air filtration system, like a gas mask. Harmful aerial particles exist in a zombie apocalypse and keeping them out of your system is key.

a new challenge -Jiangshi,"Alright , I see a lot of you looking for new zombie challenges so here's one.

The Jiangshi, literally meaning 'stiff corpse' is a zombie/vampire in Chinese folklore. Origins of the zombie comes from people transporting corpses using racks via long distances at night.

A Jiangshi can spawn via multiple methods, either via magic, vengeance, a black cat jumping over the corpse, buried in a land of bad Feng Shui (commonly known as a 'corpse keeping land') and of course bites. 

When infected/spawned, a Jiangshi is a low intelligence creature that jumps around searching for human blood to consume (although some may also consume animal blood). After consuming a certain amount the zombie will become more intelligent and more agile, some are even known to learn and use sorcery. Jiangshi can sense the breath of life forms and so not breathing around it allows one to escape safely (although this is mostly useless when the zombie has grown sentience). A Jiangshi always need to consume blood to maintain its strength, not consuming blood will not kill it but will make it rather weak.

When bitten the victim usually becomes pale and becomes more and more like a corpse, lastly he/she will die and will eventually reanimated if not disposed/ killed. One can prevent infection by applying glutinous rice on the wound to suck out the poison within the first minute of the bite, however the process is extremely painful and is described as touching a glowing red hot metal. 

The Jiangshi can be killed using items made out of peach wood, fire , the sun and items doused in black dog's blood. In some iterations human blood is also usable in killing them. There is also more methods that can kill a Jiangshi but I have excluded it due to it being more cultural and religion based.

So here is the challenge infos:

You traveled to Hong Kong alone for tourism. At some night, while you are strolling on the streets of the urban cities but suddenly you see locals running from the other directions. A guy slams into you panic stricken and he yells at you : ""僵尸“ before crawling up and continue running in the other direction.  You look in confusion trying to think of what he is warning you about before seeing zombies hopping around and biting people. One spots you and began hopping your way. You charge into a corridor and two more zombie follows suit. You reached a dead end and you prepare for your demise. A door on the left slams open and a priest comes out , killing the two zombies and signals you to follow him. He shuts the door and locks it. So now you are with him, your phone is at 29%, he speaks Cantonese and doesn't understand English.

How to stay in profit after the Zom-Poc?,"I made a post recently about meals and foods that might become more common after the crash which lead me to thinking about how popular a good cook would become, which in turn got me thinking about other valuable positions, jobs and industries within a settlement or other parts of the new world. A couple of my ideas include

**The brewer-** Making beer, vodka, rum, vinegar, cider, etc.

Life is going to suck in many ways post-poc so alcohol seems like an obvious prized asset. More importantly it also creates a longer lasting source of clean water so this one seems like an obvious first place to go for water potability, food preservation (vinegars) and probably useful trade items too.

**The soap maker-**

Hygiene tends to be one of the most under appreciated aspects of post apocalyptic scenarios in my experience, despite the fact it used to be responsible for several of our leading causes of death until recently. If your zom-poc universe uses the idea of an infection then this becomes several times more valuable, but even in your standard romero style zombie scenario soap is still incredibly useful and again, easy to trade.

It's also very easy to manufacture on low tech- all you need is a combination of fat (usually vegetable oils or something like lard/tallow) and a lye (usually potassium from charcoal and water) for a basic soft soap.

**The power supplier-**

Another obvious trade unit is the kilowatt hour. I suspect most settlements will share power supplies from combinations of wind/water turbines, solar panels etc but if you have other settlements nearby or somewhere where not everyone has access to power (and you do) then no doubt your power sources will become a useful commodity and likely need both basic protection and management making a mini industry.

How much is a kilowatt hour worth in terms of food or other assets? Like anything, it's worth as much as people are willing to pay but I honestly have no idea what that might be. Early on mobile phones are most peoples means of navigation via GPS and downloaded maps, there's also battery powered hand-held radios and battery powered flashlights and lamps, and once electric vehicles become the remaining methods of transport I suspect they'll become incredibly valuable, so there will always be demand for power.

You are alone; there's no other survivors in in your home, and you haven't seen or heard from anyone since the localized apocalypse started.  The surrounding area has been looted entirely, and it's come to your realization that you must leave your house to find a new base, somewhere else in the city.  

The question is; where will you go?

Why does nobody live in suburban towns in these zombie shows/movies,"Speaking for America more specifically but this can apply anywhere. 

But in these apocalypse shows and movies you rarely see anyone in gated and cozy suburban neighborhoods. They are either in cities or in rural areas. From a realistic standpoint if an apocalypse does happen I think most people will flee to the Central States or Canada because they have lots of farmland, freshwater sources, and lower population. But why doesn’t anybody just go to some neighborhood and live it out there. Zombies will mostly come from cities where there are lots of people.

How realistic do you suppose the barbarism of the walking dead is?,"In the walking dead it seems like every character is a raging sociopath. We've seen cannibals, genocidal maniacs, people who think they're gods, and the list goes on. I personally think after 10 years of anarchy, this sort of niche barbarism and savagery wouldn't exist anymore, or at least be very fringe. Realistically, models such as the saviors or the coalition should gradually become the norm. Humans will naturally trend towards settlements or nomadic systems, with an emphasis on trade or extortion. The groups who ravage communities and engage in unrestricted bloodlust will eventually burn out. It should not be sustainable. An example would be the cannibals at terminus. Even if Rick didn't level the joint, eventually they'd killed everyone in a given radius, or attracted the attention of the Saviors or someone else with the fire power to erase them from existence. Chaos is simply unsustainable. This is not to suggest that assholes wouldn't survive. Organizations like the saviors would likely persist and thrive just as the coalition does, and some of these organizations will undoubtedly vary in systems of control and organizations, but anything as unstable or short sided as the whispers or terminus would eventually fail and starve to death, or be leveled but more stable forces.

Invasion of the blanks ( not just people become zombies, but, anything with a "" human"" like appearance,  that ISNT alive, aka, mannequins)

My friend ate a gas station chilli dog ( zombies controlled by locust horde. Can appear normal, but, have there brain taken over. Government trying to keep it secret. )

The convocation ( zombies infested with evil birds. Maintain full intelligence, act like a cult. )

The neverglade mysteries ( zombies created by watching specific broadcast frequency.  Linked to hivemind )

Something killed my dog, now, the other half is trying to kill me ( cranial trauma doesnt work, only muscles needed to move the body. The thing sense heat.

For those wondering, yes. This is just like the infected people, from, the movie "" splinter"" , where there trapped in the gas station )

Movies;

Splinter

The video dead ( zombies can spawn from a cursed tv, or, other TV's, on the right station. They fear there own reflection, they tear themselves to shreds if trapped, they primarily attack those, who appear afraid of them, and, they need to "" think there dead"" , then, be left to decompose, when killed, rather then cranial trauma. A chainsaw / bow and arrow, is ussed in the film, to that effect. )

The blind dead ( original,  undead zombies. Only die through burning. Blind, but, let them get to close, and, they can hear your heartbeat. Can still use tools, like swords. Also, have undead horses. )

Dead meat ( it's the meat that's infected, not the whole body. Can attack as the whole body, but, anything with muscle tissue, is still a danger. )

Zombi 5, the killing birds. ( zombies are part ghost. Can wrip through walls, seemingly, from another plane. Not as strong on this plane, though. )

Children shouldn't play with dead things ( zombies caused by new infrasonic wave, that, causes violence in insects, and, ANYTHING, with, only "" primitive"" brain function, overstimulating the "" lizard brain"" of dead bodies and premature infants, to make them animate and violent. Anything that dies in the radius, is effected. )

The children ( child zombies with black fingernails, have microwave hands, due to toxic fume exposure. )

Invasion of the brain eaters ( alien parasites take over there hosts, making them into mind controlled slaves, with all there former knowledge and memories, but, still technically dead. )

Invasion from venus ( alien from venus tricks scientist. Usses mind controling "" bio robot"" bats, to try and take over town. )

Attack of the mushroom people ( fungal mushroom infects host, while putting them in a "" hypnogajic"" like delirium, where, they begin to sabotage others, to try and "" convince"" them, to.... well, to eat the mushrooms. Failing that, they simply attack. )

Volcano zombies , aka, the burning dead ( zombies set things on fire with touch)

Mulberry street. ( zombies slowly become "" were rats "" )

Perkins 14 ( zombies are a group of tortured, mentally deficient youths, who, due to there parents trying to discredit his "" cult deprograming research"" , he reversed, to turn them into "" ninja zombies"" , immune to pain)

The absurd ( psycho killer clots very quickly and efficiently,  alongside regenerating from the clots, like an axolotl.  Decapitation is about the only thing that stops it, followed by cremation)

The hand ( hand exposed to extraterrestrial radiation, can take over the minds of those it has had physical contact with, making them murderous sociopaths )

The jason virus ( novel ) ( jason vorhees cells escape, creating a "" zombie like"" virus, that, slowly turns, any of those infected, into a copy, of, jason vorhees)

Tetsuo ( all those connected, to, the man who murdered the "" metal fetishist""  , via vehicular manslaughter, slowly "" grow"" solutions, to problems they may perceive, out of metal, gaining a state of "" delirium"" in the process. Near the end, its implied, that, the "" hybrid monster"" , can cause this, and, potentially,  spread it, simply by touch)

Night of the creeps ( zombies resurrected,  via brain eating, alien slugs, that, can even reanimate "" skeletal"" zombies)

Black lantern zombies ( darkest night) ( zombies, with all the powers, of, a green lantern ring)

Aquarium of the dead ( zombie marine / semi marine animals. They are blind. They hunt by sound ) ( also.... surprisingly, a good movie. If you felt decent characterization in scriptwriting, that DOESNT paint characters,  as strawmen or shallow stereotypes,  was lacking in your recent film lineup, you will WEAP at this movie. I did. )

Pontypool ( memetic zombie virus, infects people, via the english language, and, making them "" forget words"" , causing mental instability.  )

Invasion of the blood mutants ( "" vampire"" monsters, that grow various animal bits and extremeties, invalid the known universe in the future )

I am a hero ( it's in japan. Only one man has a gun. A shotgun. And, he's trained with it. The zombies gain superhuman strength and agility, and, can mimicked the activities, most done in life. Example; a professional diver zombie, can jump super high, through repetitive form training, ending up on the roof. )

Tourist trap ( psychic psychotic carny, can turn people into wax replicas, and, alongside other wax figures, control them. )

Night of something strange ( zombies can mutate, and, are controlled by alien paracite, in the genitals, not the brain. )

Pyromaniac ( zombies are victims of a psycho killer with a home made flaimthrower. Turn him into "" similar "" zombie, at the end. )

Stung ( zombies piloted by "" light sensitive"" species of parasitic insect. Insect seems similar, to killer bees )


The frozen dead; zombies drain "" life force"" , via heat energy, freezing all they touch.

Transport &amp; Transport Routes Post-Zompoc?,"I got to thinking about walking, driving, cycling and general transport post-poc and wondered if anyone had any input on the same.

I recently noticed that almost all rail lines (at least here in the UK) are completely railed off on both sides with steel fencing in the cities, and even outside of cities for most most or all of the line. Other than falling from bridges and access via non closed stations it seems like these would serve as fairly safe, very low Z-Traffic walking routes within or in/out of the cities, and makeshift [Rail Trolleys](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/PTDDBJ/old-railway-handcar-pump-trolley-displayed-at-the-downssteam-tourist-railway-museum-drayton-toowoomba-southern-queensland-qld-australia-PTDDBJ.jpg) and bicycle lanes next to the rail lines might serve as major personnel and goods transport methods.

I also thought about motorways and standard roads and I think in most scenarios these would be either almost completely empty, or largely unusable in most urban/populated areas without a cow catcher and a lot of heft and horsepower behind the wheel to deal with obstruction and the consequences of early panic, so heavy trucks being the only transport option I could think of, at least in the initial stages. Then after a year or two most fuel and diesel will expire so electric vehicles or diesel engines with remaining vegetable oil become the only viable options since biofuel is an unrealistic luxury for a while, and beyond that I believe most roads only last a few decades without maintenance.

Lastly, most cities here are connected by canal or the sea. The former is completely open by foot and therefore particularly dangerous, but the latter served as our transport for most of our history and it seems it'll serve that purpose again post-poc, so being in control of a safe harbour may well be a major benefit to any city dwellers.

Fuel for thought.,"Approximately 6 months after all hell breaks loose the fuel in the tanks of abandoned vehicles will be too oxidised to run engines. Petrol or diesel. After a year even fuel stored carefully in airtight containers will be mostly useless too.  
Pack and draft animals will become essential but engines can still be extremely useful for electricity generation and fast scouting transport if you have parts, tools and useable fuel. Lubricating engine oil will last, unopened for many years.
With enough land you can eventually grow crops and make biodiesel but ethanol from wood is much easier on a small scale and will run many petrol engines with little adjustment. It’s knowledge like this that could make you a highly valuable addition to an established group.

Need Help Proofing Zombie Disease,"I'm trying to make a somewhat scientifically sound infection that has yet to be written about. What I have so far is a kind of bacterial infection.

This bacteria is:

A photoautotroph (makes its own food with light like plants)

Is an extremophile (lives through extreme temperatures like excessive heat or cold, even radiation)

It will be photosynthetic bacteria which means that it is a bacteria that contains a green pigment called bacteriochlorophyll which is similar to chlorophyll that enables the organism to photosynthesize.

The reason for all of these is that it creates a realistic way for zombies to sustain themselves when food is unavailable (photosynthesis). These zombies will essentially be living creatures that were people altered after death and ""brought back to life"" as a living organisms. Now they will not have nerves or pain receptors so they are still behaving as ""walking dead zombies/walkers"" and won't be slowed by wounds or gunshots in areas other than the head unless they are knocked back from the blow.

The disease itself will be passed through bites, blood, and saliva getting into open wounds or mucosal membranes such as the mouth, ears, nose, eyes, and nether regions for lack of a better term. Once in the host, the bacteria will act like bacterial menengitis and spreads throughout the central nervous system, and ultimately arriving in the brain. From there, it will concentrate by the process of binary fission. Here, the bacteria will act sort of like cordyceps fungi, in the sense that it hijacks the brain and gives it a main objective, to hunt and consume humans, or any other organism that presents itself.

The zombies themselves will have a very slow metabolism which will allow them to last longer before starving, especially when photosynthesis is part of the equation which rules out just waiting for the zombies to decompose. A way to effectively neutralize them is to perhaps contain them in a dark warehouse without light to starve them, but this may take some time and of course, an empty warehouse to spare.

Here's how you guys can help:

In the comments, it would be really helpful to know what can be changed/improved with this zombie infection and how this bacteria would realistically be created (from nature, an experiment?). I'm looking for some really offbeat ways to spice up the zombie genre and would be so grateful for your help. I feel like I have a pretty solid idea of what I'm looking for in a zombie but I don't know how the infection would spiral out of control so much that it becomes an apocalypse, how the government would handle it, or a unique enough way for the bacteria to be discovered, created, and otherwise become widespread enough to ensue an apocalyptic scenario.

A list of tips that you may not think about right away.,"Here's a list that could help you in the Zombie Apocalypse which I've thought about over the years that you may not think of right away.

1. Tape magazines on your arms and legs for armor (thanks WWZ)

2. Cut small holes in empty cans, put rocks in the cans and tie string through each side. This can work as a sound alarm in a small camp.

3. Sharp pencils can pierce a skull easier than scissors.

4. Common household items that you may not think about when looking for a weapon: pans, brooms, guitars, rolling pins, back of the toilet seat, basically anything hard and blunt.

5. Put hard items (rocks/stones, batteries, bottle caps etc) in a sock and you've got yourself a semi-decent weapon.

6. Bicycles are going to be better than cars. They're quiet and don't require fuel / charging. If you take your car, make sure you bring your bike too.

7. Kinda common sense but if you're using a sword or machete, swing *down* into the skull instead of stabbing.

8. Dinner / egg timers are a good distraction. Set them to go off after a few seconds and toss them away from you. Zombies may stop following you and follow the noise instead. (Thanks TWD)

9. Instead of raiding common shops / stores for supplies, go to the stores warehouse buildings. Not a lot of people would think to go there at the start and there's likely gonna be supplies left over. Even if they do, warehouses are so packed you're bound to find something.

10. A lot of people seem to think steelcap boots are the best shoes to wear.. you'd be better off wearing trainers. Boots are heavy and loud and will only save you from hurting your feet. You're gonna be running a lot more than you're gonna be dropping shit on your toes.

What skill is underrated?,"Hello surviving peeps

So we all know the basic skills that make surviving a bit easier, medical skills, the basics of combat, farming, water purifying, mechanics and engineering, leadership, etc.

But what about the more unusual skills?
Discuss amongst yourselves two things, what is an unusual and underrated skill that would help in 3 settings

•as a singular lone survivor on the move.

•as a small group, in a small base starting to build.

•in a well established community, building a new future.

Along with some reasons why you believe they would be useful

For me, I think a singular survivor trait would be botany. Being on the go all the time means that finding food is only gonna get harder, so why not go back to our roots (literally) and pick foods that you know can be eaten. Amaranth and oyster mushrooms are literally everywhere and nobody knows how to eat em.
For a small group, I’m gonna go with dog training. A dog can be incredibly helpful when you’re a bit short on man power and having someone who can help train them would be a huge help.
For large communities I’m gonna go with psychology/counseling.

Underrated zombie apocalypse weapon,"As a former competitive fencer, the weapon of choice I would go with in an apocalypse would be a rapier or epee style sword.
Since you hold the weapon out like a spear instead of up like a sword, you get a lot more range. And a quick stab from one would easily go through a zombies head. I think the weapon to best compare this too would be the spear, a tried and true zombie weapon. Spears are good, and can have a lot more range than a rapier. But I think where the rapier excels is how maneuverable it is. It’s one handed, a spear is much harder to one hand, it’s mostly a two handed weapon. So you could easily have something in the off hand and use a rapier. It also (in my personal opinion) is a little easier to stab with. With a two handed spear, to stab it, you have to have it above your shoulder or off the side, since you need space behind the weapon and it takes two hands. A rapier, you can extend right out in front of you easily.

When compared to a blunt force weapon, a rapier could much more quick and easily take out zombies. Swinging requires energy and time, a quick thrust is concentrated energy in a very small point, which doesn’t require much energy, and is very quick. You could be poking through zombie skulls every second with a little practice. 

The only real problem, is getting your hands on one. You could sharpen a piece of metal and attach a handle, and that’d work. Or you could loot a mall ninja sword shop, there’s always tons of them. It’d be a tricky find still, but a good weapon if you had it on you.",1,1628241863,MrCatSquid,44,1,True,2021-08-06,"underrated zombie apocalypse weapon as a former competitive fencer, the weapon of choice i would go with in an apocalypse would be a rapier or epee style sword.

What clothes/armor would be optimal for a Zpoc?,"When choosing clothes/armor I think the most important thing is the weight to protection ratio, and that it does not impede your ability to do day to day things, and fight. 

For the upper body something like a leather jacket as an outermost layer I think would be ideal. You can also wrap the forearms or maybe even the whole sleeves with duct tape for extra protection. If it is not to hot you can also wear a sweatshirt style jacket underneath for padding, since the leather jacket would not protect from the force of the zombies jaw, if it breaks your wrist you will have a not so fun time. You also might want to have a hood you can easily pull on to protect your neck and head from behind, I would probably only put the hood on if I’m entering a building because in the open I dont think it would be necessary. I would also have a good pair of leather gloves on to protect my hands, and if I know I am going into a fight I would also wrap my hands like a boxer underneath the gloves to protect them from breaking if I have to punch something really hard. I would also have a pair of googles on hand and maybe a bandanna/mask to make sure i dont get any zombie fluids in me.

For my lower body I would probably wear two pairs of socks to protect my lower legs from bites somewhat, and I would most likely wear a comfortable pair of either boots or running shoes. It would depend on the situation, if i am going to be working hard and carrying a lot of weight, or if I am going into a fight I would probably go with boots, for their extra protection and because they are what I am used to for doing heavy work, a rolled ankle in a Zpoc would not be good. The only time I would wear running shoes would be if I had to run a long distance, and even then I would still consider boots. For pants I would wear a pair of jeans, and I would give them the duct tape treatment for the extra protection.

I think that this setup would be my optimal day to day clothing/armor, I would love to hear what you guys think. What would you change? Any major flaws with my setup?

•3 armed and trained guards, each carrying an assault rifle and wearing a heavy leather jacket and helmet to protect against bites.

•1 medic, carrying a backpack with a basic first aid kit, some simple drugs for headaches, colds and pain relief, and some miscellaneous items based off of the individual needs of your group (epi-pens, inhalers, etc).

•4 civilians you’ve rescued, two of which are armed. One of them is equipped with shovel, and the other, a baseball bat.

this begs the question of what to do with your bandwidth and immediately made me think of [wikipedia database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:database_download) which clocks in at 45-99gb and would probably be the best single resource people could download while the world goes to shit outside. would this even be feasible given that most people probably have the same idea as the first thing they'd download and thus latency would potentially make it a poor time investment or choice?

Your personal and very own melee weapon against the Undead,"It's the apocalypse. You have an experienced blacksmith in your settlement with a variety of weapon parts and tools at his disposal and he is offering to design and forge a melee weapon just for you.

What would you have?

I would pick a Morning Star with a handle made of bone to make it as light as possible and durable as well. I'd also add an additional long and sharp blade on the top so I can jab skulls for quick and instant kills and cleave heads with it.

I'd want to make sure it's long but not too long that it becomes a two handed weapon. I feel a one handed weapon is more flexible, easier and quicker to use. In my opinion a two handed sword like a large axe or a sword would be too heavy, sluggish and hard to use in quick motions.

The Walking Dead: How effective is Morgan's tripwire axe trap shown in the third season?,"I suppose the title jumps right to the point of this post but for further context continue reading!

I am in the midst of writing a series of short stories that focus on world-building and exploring character-driven plots in the zombie apocalypse; I don't necessarily plan on publishing but it's been a fun hobby to pursue during the summer break. I am creating a character that develops a knack for traps, Kevin McCallister Style, but a bit more grownup.

The character in question is rigging up a relatively easy trap for the first time, similar to Morgan's from the third season. The tripwire will be at the top of the frame, triggered when the door is opened and gruesomely sending an axe through any intruder's head.

Calibre .22 Long Rifle in a Zombie Apokalypse?,"Long Time Zombie-Fan, relatively new Redditor.

So heres my Question for you. Would you consider a .22 lr weapon in the Zombieapokalypse?

I mean sure, they are much cooler/bigger choices out there like AR-15, Kalaschnikows or every Type of Shotgun out there like Double Barrell, Pump or Lever Action or Semi Auto.

.22 LR is pretty small calibre and is mostly used for target shooting or hunting small animals/pests like Rabbits or Racoons. You maybe need more than one shot even to the head to kill the target for good.

But here are my points

\-.22 lr is pretty common in nearly every part of the world, even countries with strict gun laws like the UK or Germany

\-.22 lr has an effective Range of 150 Meters, but still can be lethal at up to 400 Meters

\-There are Rifles and Pistols in this Calibre. So when both your Rifle and your pistol are in the same calibre you only need one type of ammo

\-Its portable. 2.000 Rounds of .22 lr ammo weight about seven kilogramm so you travel light.

\-Its easy for beginners. You cant give someone without knowledge of guns a .308 Winchester or .223 Remington and let them figure it out

\-And it can be used as a hunting weapon. I mean Killing Zombies is one Thing, but dying of starvationis the other thing. And you cant eat a rabbit which was blown away with a 12 Gauge.

Pond/Stagnant water filtration.,"Sometimes your only source is going resemble soup more the water. Simply boiling isn't gonna be enough. So what do you do in these situations? 

Well there is a method that is pretty simple, and relatively easy to find the materials for. The two hardest, if you can call them that, are two  2 liter bottles (or larger) and cheese cloth or gauze pad. The third item is Twine/string/rubber and/etc...

Part I

Assuming you have a knife/scissors.

On the first bottle cut the base off, leaving as much as you can of the body of the bottle as well as the neck/opening intact. Place cheese cloth/gauze over the opening and secure with twine or other suggested items. 

On the second bottle do the opposite. Cut the upper part, including the neck and opening off. Leaving as much of the body and base as you can. 

Place bottle one, opening/neck down into the second bottle so that you have a funnel leading to an empty base. Sometimes they fit snuggly together, but if not, on the large opening of your funnel cut a slit not more then a 1/2 in several times around the bottle. Fold some of the flaps in, bend some if the flaps out. This should help secure them together. 


Part II

Filling material. 

Crush up charcoal from a previous days fire. Coals must be dry and cold. (do not use charcoal briquettes for grilling) you want them to be of course granules, slightly bigger then sand. We don't want powder. Place into funnel about 3 in thick. 

Next add between 1/2-3/4 in. of sand. Above sand add about an inch of small gravel. Repeat sand layer. Then again with a second gravel layer.

What's your fictional character zombie apocalypse team?,"So first off gonna lay out some ground rules

-No one with superpowers, 

-their equipment starting off is only what they can reasonably carry or at most have loaded in a car

-when you list a character list what they are from and what their role is.

-One person per franchise

-if the character has a family or anyone else they'd reasonably wanna take along account for them think of how many mouths there are to feed

And if you feel like it lay out a little story, how do these characters interact what conflict do they face, what's their plans does anyone die? Hey passionate about this!



Personally and for the sake of example here's mine


-Jonathan Kramer (Saw) the mechanic

It was a hard choice between him and Amanda on one hand he's old and probably won't last more than a few years in the apocalypse. Five at best by my own predictions and while he is no where mentally stable he's reasonable and unlike Amanda probably wouldn't try anything stupid for the sake of twisted morals I feel he'd be more manageable than Amanda and therefore the better choice

-Michael Desanta (gta 5) the leader

Michael is very expirienced, he's selfish and focused on self preservation but that might benefit the group make him more cautious and less impulsive. Lester was also an option but his sickness would most likely be a very big issue, and Trevor is simply way too unstable to be in a large group for extended periods of time were talking years.

Ludwig medic (TF2) the medic

Choosing a medical care professional is essential in a zombie team, however turns out it's really hard since medics in videogames or media in general aren't usually main characters or even side characters. If I had a better choice I would have disqualified him for the same reason I did Trevor Philips but he's by far not only one of the very few medics in fiction I know of but one of the most impressive ones as well

Sebastian Castellanos (The evil within) the foot soldier

A zombie team needs people to go out and do things in fact it usually need multiple. Sebastian is a cop, he has used guns and fought enemies similar to the undead and frankly more impressive than the undead. 

Futaba Sakura (Persona 5) the planer

Sakura is a genius, if they could return power to a base she could easily find the best location of any supplies they are looking for, the building plans so they have a way in and out and  alot of other things drones maybe to track or distract zombies? Drones with death machines with her working with John?

Pierce Washington (Saints row) The foot soldier

Like I said with Sebastian, people who go out and do things are needed. I didn't want to choose oleg because he basically has superstrength and we stated strictly no superpowers and johnny gat is nearly as bad as Trevor although he would certainly be more manageable. Peirce is a criminal yes but he's also very likeable and charming being a comic relief.

And finally to finish the list off

Lee Everett (The walking dead tell tale) the foot soldier

A third foot soldier seems like an appropriate balance, lee has been shown in an apocalypse setting doing very well. Lee is like many of the characters on this list a criminal but a very kind and down to earth one.


.going over all the characters families

John - 0 
Michael - 3
Medic - 0
Sebastian - 1
Futaba - 1 
Peirce - 0
And Lee - 1 

In total 13 mouths to feed, it's a big group but I've seen bigger in zombie apocalypse fiction.

For character interactions alot of these guys are criminals, John, Michael, Peirce and Lee, futaba too if you count her cyber stuff.
I don't think the cop Sebastian would be very comfortable at first. In fact it would take alot of growing close to them begrudgingly hearing the compassion from guys like lee for Sebastian to even remotely accept the group.

And I doubt he'd ever fully accept some of the worse members of this group like the serial killer John.

John is reasonable however weve seen that dispite mental illness and all he's not the type to antagonize, he'd probably try to avoid any direct confrontation with Sebastian given the way larger threat of a zombie apocalypse.

How would society handle this type of virus?,"So, the new virus starts out infecting people at a pace similar to COVID-19, spreading through sneezing and coughing, and perhaps even surfaces as well.

They either remain in their aggressive state which slowly gets worse, or they experience a sudden increase in intelligence, yes IQ, and get better.

So... the virus doesn't create zombies that try to eat flesh, but simply makes everyone infected either become super smart or go super crazy becoming physically dangerous to be around.

Need help proofing my zombie disease for errors,,1,1626473690,Sedated_Sorrow,0,1,True,2021-07-16,need help proofing my zombie disease for errors 
My idea of a possible type of zombie.,"The ""traditional"" slow moving, dumb rotting corpse type zombies have many flaws that would make them impossible to exist. The biggest flaws probably being decomposition and lack of muscles.

But what if there was a virus that would not turn humans to those  traditional zombies but it would just make them aggressive, paranoid and lacking of fine motor skills. 

Meaning: They dont rot. They could understand speech and they could speak, they are human after all. Perhaps they could even use simple tools or in some cases firearms.

They would still need water, food and oxygen to survive and the aggressiveness paranoia and need for food would make them kill and devour anything that moves would it be a squirrel, your neighbours cat, your neighbour or you.

I know the perfect place to go for a 7 days to die kind off apocolypse.,"I did some research and i came to the conclusion what the perfect place to go is in a zombie apocalypse.

- plenty of water ( rules of three  3 hours under exterme weather 3 days without water 3 weeks without food)
- cold enough to kill insects (you don't know whatever they are carrying around)
- warm enough to grow food ( you don't want to cold otherwise the food won't grow)

Center mass shots - the ultimate point of aim in a zombie apocalypse.,"Center mass shots (e.g. firing a gun at the center of a target, or more exactly aiming at the sternum) are *the* ultimate place where you should be aiming in a ZA. Something that people rarely understand is that bullets aren't simply damage rays that make people die faster, they are pieces of heavy metal flying through the air at multiple miles per second. Think about the secondary effects of that for a minute. We all know bullets cause internal damage, but the amount of kinetic energy being carried by that bullet is insane. The kinetic energy from one 5.56 is like 10 bodybuilders punching you, concentrated down into a half-inch point, across a period of about half a millisecond. That will knock almost anything even vaguely human down, and it only has more effects as the target gets faster. 

Here's what will happen to every target that could threaten your life in a ZA, with a center-mass shot with an AR-15:

**Slow-moving, typical headshot-only zombies -** Center mass shots will be the least effective on these types. While the kinetic energy will still be great, it won't be a 100% chance of temporary incapacitation.

**Slow-moving, weak zombies -** Yeah, it'll probably die. 5.56x45mms do a lot of movement in the body, so it would probably end up lacerating both lungs and the heart. The kinetic energy's less important here.

**Typical weak sprinters -** If it's running towards you, the same internal damage as the slow-moving weak zed would happen, though additionally the kinetic energy would knock it over in an instant, allowing you to finish it off with a blunt weapon or just buy you time to run, if it doesn't die from the internal damage before you get to it.

**Humans -** Similar to the sprinters, although you could look up 1. Liveleak | or 2. a YouTube channel called PoliceActivity for an example of what it would do here. Especially on PoliceActivity, notice how they rarely get back up after being shot once in the center mass, and if they do, they're not in a condition to fight more. Without paramedics and hospitals, center mass shots on a human have nearly a 100% chance to kill. The only real variable would be how long it takes to kill.

Hell, headshots are probably the WORST place to aim, unless they're a headshot-only zed. Compare the size of your chest to the size of your head, and unless you're a cartoon character, you'll see why I say this.

PPE: Keep your mask Strapped or get Clapped,"Covid made me realize the importance of PPE. The traditional ZV spreads through the ingestion or commingling of bodily fluids. PPE doesn't just save you from possible infection from the Z virus, it also saves you from many other complications.

Here are the three most important PPE and their uses during the Zombie Apocalypse.

Mask: A mask will protect your mouth from accidentally ingesting hazardous materials and bodily fluids. During the ZA there will be times when you physically exert yourself. A mask will allow you to breathe with your mouth and nose protected.

Choose a mask that covers both your mout and nose and will stop dangerous materials from entering. A modern gas mask will do this perfectly. 


Eye protection: Eye Pro is just as important as a mask. Eye protection will stop any objects or bodily fluids from coming in contact with your eyes. Obscured vision from viscera and other things is dangerous. In addition the eyes are a spot for tge virus to enter your body (That being said, dont touch your face). 

Choose eye protection that is easy to clean. Full seal goggles are preffered, although simple chemists and shop glasses will work as a temporary solution. A Motorcicle helmet might work too. (Full seal airsoft or Ski goggles are a good solution.)


Body and skin protection: find something to cover and protect your skin from scratcher and bites. Something that would hold up against the elements.

A heavy jacket or winter coat would do wonders. In addition get knee and elbow pads or else your knees and elbows will get scaped up and from there infected.

Those are the three most important types of PPE for the  zombie apocalypse.

What weapon would be best to use in a zombie apocalypse,"Before I begin, this is all in my opinion.

So a zombie outbreak starts. To defend yourself, you will need something like a gun. But what gun is the best. And several problems come to having a gun in a zombie apocalypse.

1. No more bullets are produced, so you will need a lot of ammo, that can be saved for a long time
2. You will need a gun that can last a very long time
3. You will need a gun that can support things like silencers or suppressors, to keep a low profile

In my opinion, the best weapon to use in a zombie apocalypse would be a M4A1, or a M1 Carbine. It is a automatic rifle with a 30 round mag and uses 7.62 ammo, one of the most common types of gun ammo out there. Here is why it would be the best gun (in my opinion)

1. Little to no effort to find one. Very common rifle.
2. Can use extended mags, so more ammo can be used per mag
3. Supports silencers and suppressors, making it a silent weapon.
4. Can support various types of Scopes and Sights
5. Has a lightweight, sleek profile, making it easy to use and carry around
6. Besides being an assault rifle, it also has a single shot mode and burst mode, making it a decent sniper if you need to use it in a sniping situation.
7. Very powerful rifle

Dogs as a threat,"This came to my thought when I was chased by a feral dog while jogging. Barely escaped by running. 

Untamed dogs are essentially smaller wolves sharing many characteristics. Untamed dogs are pack predators, and probably will attack survivors if they do not have any food/accidently tread into their territory. Dogs are fast and can chase its prey relentlessly if it chose to, in this case humans. 

Dogs will bark at anyone, potentially alerting unfriendly survivors and or zombies. If it alerts zombies than gives an unlucky survivor a bite in the leg well the guy's fate is sealed. 

There's also the possibility of dogs having rabies.

Home depot survival base idea.,"Alright so every one who lives in the US has been to home depot or lowes once in their life or for those who don't have a home depot or lowes has been to some sort of warehouse style store. That has those huge shelves that are multiple feet above ground. Now imagine taking some lumber (if it wasn't all bought or stolen) or loading ramps and laying them across isles between those huge shelves. Now if you were able to do that across all the isles you would be able to navigate the store and build a base within one of the shelves, without any chances of zombies being able to get to you assuming they're not able to climb. Assuming that there was still some plywood left you could box a shelf in and use a hand saw to cut through the floor of the shelve to allow for multiple stories within a ""base"".  Having this setup would not only allow you to navigate the store without bumping into any dead but it would also give you a really op advantage point allowing  against an un wanted group if they  entered the store.

Pros and Cons of having zombies around your camp,"This post is based on Walking Dead Zombies, the example Camp has large numbers, self sustainable food and water supply and has a Secure Wall surrounding it, it also has Alot of Resources.

Pros:

Defence (Pro) : The zombies could attack any unwanted groups, the zombies could attack any raiders.

Weaponry (Pro) : Zombies could be captured and used as Weaponry using what dog catchers use.

Isolation (Pro) : Survivor groups may avoid your Camp entirely due to zombies in the mass.

Research (Pro) : With alot of test subjects outside, with the right people and resources, your Camp could figure out a Cure or something.

Cons:

Defence (Con) : Zombies may disrupt movement of Traders, Operations and even other smaller Camps

Weaponry (Con) : Zombies could be more occupied on the person using the weapon and not the person they are using the zombie against. They could break freenand there would be no spare space to put the Zombie Weaponry

Isolation (Con) : If food and water sources stop being reliable there would be nobody to exchange goods with due to the Isolation of the camp

What is everyone's thoughts on gasifiers? (burning wood at extreme temps to power gas engines),"Assuming you had the know how and the supplies to build something like this would you?

Examples, [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyTqo4mCUUY) , [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYGKn12Weu4) and [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9v8denLLe0)

My initial thought would to build a gasifier to run a small invertor generator like one of those 1kw Hondas which are extremally quite. I would use the generator to charge up a battery bank or to run some larger loads if I didn't have access to solar or if the sun hasn't been out due to weather or the season. A gasifier could also be used to power an even bigger generator shown [here](https://youtu.be/NXGVkcwkGR0?t=89) to power an entire camp or a whole house generator. They've also been used to power small car engines, only downside is that you just can't turn a key and drive away on a moments notice due to the fire having to reach a certain temp. 

Cons.

Noise. Yes not all generators are extremally loud but some are and lets face it the noise of one would not only attract zombies but other humans. You could avoid this by placing it in a ""sound proofed"" box with the proper venting or run it underground again with the proper venting or if you're in a super tall building you could place it on the roof.

Maintenance . Eventually something will break and you won't always have the skill nor parts to fix it. However depending who you have in your group or where you're located out of this could be avoided. For example I live in FL and there's thousands of generator repair shops and stores that sell parts around me. Depending on the generator you might also be able to find the parts in regular stores.

Having the skill to build one of these.

Limit of power. I'm not an expert but I'm sure there must be a limit to how big of a engine you can power with wood.

Pros

Water. With this new source of power you'll be able to run well pumps and water purifiers. Hell you might even be able to get a part of the city water plant back up with enough power and people. 

Amenities. With this power you'll be able to run stoves, fridges, ice makers, water pumps, water heaters and maybe a/c.

Transpiration. This method could also be used to fuel cars.

"Industrial Pallet Wrap, New Must Have item for scavenging?","Okay so got into a tangent argument with a friend about unconventional (read; almost stupid) ways to ""wall off"" roads in a hurry without vast quantities of materials. 

We somehow got to discussing Industrial Saran Wrap, the kind used to wrap up pallets for delivery, &amp; the use to said plastic wrap to go between things like traffic lights or support posts etc, making an impromptu ""wall"". Enough layers of wrap makes it very difficult to cut through without a knife. Not going to stop hundreds of bodies squished against it (although its got enough of a stretch that it could  probably handle it for a little while) but if Zambis came in ones &amp; twos they're not likely to get past it, that's even if they don't just straight ignore it like they do with any solid brick or wood type wall. Plus you can even get opaque black wrap too, which would help with concealment. 

This discussion led to if not plastic wrap maybe rope, like a row of tight rope tied between lampposts going from ankle to head height, would that work? If so how little rope is needed? Could you reduce it down to just simply 1 decently strong tight rope roughly chest height? I mean it wouldn't stop children, dwarfs or anyone unfortunate enough to have had their legs chewed into non-use.

"Is ""Zombie Apocalypse"" a Metaphor?","This photo may depict some type of unrest based on one set of beliefs or another. I submit the reason for the unrest is irrelevant for this discussion. Rather the decision of these individuals, regardless of motivation, to leave their homes and take part in unrest is what I am asking you to consider.

When we refer to “Zombies”, could we be referring to individuals similar to these?

Perhaps, in reality, these are normal individuals who simply have prepared less for an emergency than we have. Maybe they will be the “zombies” that discuss throughout this subreddit? What about those who define injustice differently than we do; or perhaps those who have a hair-trigger when it comes to partaking in unrest regardless of the motivation.

· A network attack on the power-grid causes a massive, weeks-long blackout throughout your area during unseasonably hot/cold weather.

· Congress holds a Constitutional Convention and successfully repeals the 2nd Amendment, and you live in Texas.

· Trump gets re-elected, and you live in Portland.

I submit that any one of these events could motivate some individuals to throw off the restraint of The Enlightenment and see them embrace their emotional/animal/ZOMBIE instincts and just burn shit down.

Debate: Baseball bats are suboptimal melee weapons against zombies,"Hey all, new to the sub but I have been diving through a lot of the posts. Just thought it would be fun to pose a counter to the seemingly popular opinion that baseball bats are optimal melee weapons against Zack (slow-moving zombies) and Zeke (fast-moving zombies).

Pros of a good bat:
-Ergonomics - Easy for anyone to wield with two hands
-Decent damage output - Seemingly, as this is hypothetical
-Abundant - Can easily be found in places that like baseball

Cons:
-Heavy - Not ideal for single-handed use (very unwieldily, in fact)
-Broad - Damage is muted by a large surface area and may require multiple swings per zombie
-Fragile - I've broken a few medium quality wood bats playing pickup baseball, they don't last that long

In my thought exercises, the cons of using a baseball bat outweigh the pros. Primarily how cumbersome they can be with one hand and that the damage isn't as much as it could be. In physics, I remember learning that a golf club can do more damage due to the concentration of force in a smaller surface area. 

Alternatives to the classic wooden bat include aluminum softball bats and cricket bats. I don't think augmenting a regular wooden bat with nails, wire, or weights would significantly add to the effectiveness, but that's up for debate as well.

Zombie armor of choice,"So a long tine ago me and my friend disscused about what armor is better in a zombie apocalypse. I said leather because its easily accesible  and provides a decent protection against bites and scratches. 
They said chainmail because it provide more of a protective shield against anything and it could be relativley cheaply made but i still had my doubts with all the noise it would make and if you're not a blacksmith you couldn't pop a set of chainmail armor into existence when you need it.

Thoughts?

Weapons for beginners (no guns),"This is for the people who buy things like katanas and think they're a badass. I've encountered quite a few people like that on this sub. Don't over-evaluate your abilities. Certain weapons you need an instructor to be properly trained with.

Basic, easy to find weapons, are the best for someone who hasn't got skills that require education (from books, teachers or just life). I myself can handle a katana and a bo staff so when ""self-trained"" people it's a little bit like when people say they know karate from watching Cobra Kai.

Before I start this, you will need adult supervision if ur under eighteen for some of these weapons. You will also need to be able to put time and money in for a lot of them.

The ranged weapons with reusable ammo I suggest you self-train with: 

a three part Recurve bow (if you get interested in archery then invest in a compound bow). It takes a while to get good but I suggest once you've done stationery targets, (if you can stomach it) go hunting.  

A Crossbow is a good weapon but they usually cost a bit more than a Recurve bow and won't shoot long distances (even then you would need skill to do that) but they are easier to train with and aim.

A slingshot is good for diverting sound attracted zombies, hunting small game, chucking bait into water when fishing and in the right, trained, hands, it can be deadly. 

Throwing knives, thigh pouch with a few throwing knives will always be good if your in a bad situation.

Basic melee weapons: 

A hatchet, it's simple and effective. Could be used as a weapon, and for chopping things.

Knives: not really for zombies but wild animals and humans. They have many purposes that make them essential.

Machete: you do need to practice with a machete, they have problems with getting stuck if you don't have the right technique. 

Baseball bat: due to it being easy to find and use, a baseball bat is very useful

What if there were Special Infected ?,"Normal zombies are pretty easy to deal with. The main thing you need to worry about is their number.

However, what if the virus would create some kind of Special Infected ? Imagine the L4D Special Infected or Dying Light special infected in a Walking Dead world. The virus would still spread through bites and scratches but some people would become S.I.

The Tank and The Witch (Left 4 Dead)

The Volatile and The Screamer (Dying Light)

The Butcher (Dead Island).

The Screamer is usually just a kid zombie but their scream will attract infecte and will likely stun you. The Butcher is where it gets interesting because they are very fast zombies and their tissue can regenerate, so if you engage in combat with them, not only that you stand almost no chance in melee but if you don't kill them, they regenerate.

Parasitic zombies,"So this kinda popped in my mind while I was binge watching those scape and run parasite playthroughs and kind of thought, how different will it be from running zombies against these parasite zombies. 

So for those of you who haven't heard of the mod , Scape and run parasites is about a parasite species that can infest and takeover the host and control it in a matter to hunt down prey and other victims like zombies. Similar to the crab bois from half life. There are also special evolved parasites and infected trees called bastions but we are not gonna talk about that for it will not resemble a zombie.

The major differences are

* the parasites are much, much faster than running zombies
* The head is not the only weak point , you can kill it by causing enough damage , but it does not feel pain and will still hunt you down relentlessly
* Unlike zombies , they are weak to fire
* Limbs cut off might pursue you and infect you as it can behave like an individual organism. Like a worm split in half.
* They might grow hides and structures that make them resilient to damage. They also might grow offensive methods (tendrils , stronger muscles etc...) to suit certain needs given long enough time for evolution. (Your nightmares of seeing a flying spider is one step closer)
* Unlike most zombies portrayed , animals can be infected and posses different capabilities than other infected based on the host. (For example , a cheetah infected will run at superb speeds , an elephant infected will most likely be a living tank)
* After certain time , they grow spiderlike or worm like ""offspring"" that seek out and infect other hosts
* They eat their hosts for nutrients , leaving and seeking new ones when the host is drained in their ""true form"" , which is multiple worm like creatures bonded together in the structure of its previously infected host (they are weakest in this form). They can sustain on their own when fully matured (evolved parasites)",1,1622986284,then00brathalos,2,1,True,2021-06-06,"parasitic zombies so this kinda popped in my mind while i was binge watching those scape and run parasite playthroughs and kind of thought, how different will it be from running zombies against these parasite zombies.

my father taught me how to hunt and respect mother nature. the military taught me how to survive and be ruthless. they taught me how to fight. 

i think i’d bunker down until the initial panic settled down. then i gather my gear and start heading up the mountain. eventually reaching a certain cabin that is miles into the forest. only accessible by foot or atv. 

i feel i would have the best odds out there. alone with nature. it’s quite peaceful, actually. even during the end of the world."

Is there any good zombie movie or game where it doesn't have stupid clichés?,"I want to watch or play a movie or game that doesn't have overused clichés. If a zombie movie or game has these clichés, don't suggest them to me:

1- The government collapses after a short period.

3- If a person that's new is bitten, symptoms don't show and then they turn all of a sudden, but if the protagonist is bit, symptoms show.

What are your thoughts on my gear?,"I've recently revised a lot of my gear and made several changes. I would like to hear the community's thoughts on it and what improvements I should make from here.

I've changed it into more of a bug out bag that I'll take with me in the event I have to leave my home.   
     
  
* [The exterior](https://i.imgur.com/dcTNIGN.jpg) Has [several Items attached](https://i.imgur.com/FZa7bND.jpg). A canteen and canteen cup, small forest axe with sheath, a carbon steel Mora Companion, a 90^0 angled flashlight, and an IFAK. The first aid kit [contains several items.](https://i.imgur.com/ZW48XRU.jpg) Several rolls of gauze and self adhering tape, many band-aids, alcohol/cleansing pads, a cold pack, a CAT tourniquet, an Israeli bandage, and some bleedstop. 
   
* The side pocket and top zipper pocket contain many small items. [The side pocket](https://i.imgur.com/G0wi0eP.jpg) has a mini maglite, 2 lighters, a headlamp, a compass, and a small amount of paracord. The [top zipper pocket](https://i.imgur.com/GDmgjRu.jpg) has 2 small carabiners, a measuring tape, earplugs, another lighter, a light that attaches to a hat, and 2 p38 can openers.   
* The secondary compartment is segmented into different parts. In [one small pouch](https://i.imgur.com/yia3Imx.jpg), there are lots of AAA batteries (all the lights take these), a small flash light, a ferro rod, a lensatic compass, a small tin with more earplugs, and a mosquito net for your head. The [other part of this compartment](https://i.imgur.com/Wi2uosD.jpg) contains mosquito spray, 2 flashlights, a 2 way weather radio, 2 lighters, a folding knife and multitool, a notepad and 2 pens, shooting glasses, a sewing kit, and toilet paper. [Near to those items](https://i.imgur.com/ZjwXqlf.jpg) are a 5x7 tarp, and a small survival kit which I mostly just have for the fishing line/hooks. There [is also a bag](https://i.imgur.com/PD3fEi8.jpg) which has binoculars, more cordage, a rechargable battery bank/light, and duct tape.  
  
* The [3rd compartment](https://i.imgur.com/oGWau6F.jpg) just contains a folding saw and more cordage.  
  
*  The main compartment has many items. All are segmented into different drawstring bags. [The first bag](https://i.imgur.com/0gOVqj8.jpg) has some sanitary items, a hat, many types of bags, more cordage, a water tight container with matches and lighters, and some tent pegs. [The 2nd bag](https://i.imgur.com/7Q1EYDD.jpg) has food related items. Several fruit bars, utensils, a sawyer water filter, a vac sealed ration bar, a small cup, and lots of random drink flavors/seasonings. In a [waterproof container](https://i.imgur.com/y8HqzIz.jpg), I have an emergency blanket, a mylar tent, a poncho, some acetaminophen PM, and more earplugs.

In the very rear, there is a [usb solar charger](https://i.imgur.com/82lIzBC.jpg) that can be used to charge phones as well as the battery bank.  

That is all for the bag. I know there are several redundant items such as the lighters, ear plugs, and cordage. Those are mainly to give to family/friends should they need it.

When to head out,"Let’s say you’re at home when you find out the zombie apocalypse has started and you live in a busy city in an apartment building and you know you’re going to have to leave - when is the best time to do so?


Right when it starts or waiting a little bit to go? And if you think waiting a little bit, how long ? 


I feel like leaving right away might be good because of the idea that the more “people” are around, the more invisible you are. But then, high chance of being trampled in a frenzied crowd and getting eaten alive by z’s. 


And then waiting a little bit would be good because of the aforementioned dangers of the crowd, but then I’m thinking about the risk of staying put.

Why Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is the best zombie survival simulation game,"C:DDA is a roguelike video game centered around surviving and thriving in the middle of a... cross between nuclear fallout and alien invasion?! Ok, hear me out.

**The Plot**

The essential elements of the setting are as follows: in an effort to pioneer immortality, the US government discovered links to alternate dimensions, one of which is the home of *The Blob*, a mysterious black ooze that can seemingly take over dead bodies and bring them back to life.

The Blob (through a long-winded string of events) contaminated all groundwater, turning the majority of humans into zombies. Political shenanigans ensue, nukes go off and governments declare anarchy.

By default, the game starts 5 days after the collapse of society.

A detailed rundown of events can be found [here](https://cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Timeline).

**Graphics and Difficulty**

First things first, this game doesn't have the best graphics. In fact, it can be played with only ASCII characters, therefore not having any graphics at all. The controls might be somewhat complicated too, for anyone that didn't play the likes of Dwarf Fortress before.

However, that simplicity in aesthetics is what allows this game to be arguably the most in-depth simulation of a zombie apocalypse.

The game is difficult. Difficult in the sense that, it's not a zombie *slaughtering* game. It's survival in the purest sense. Your character will find themself:

* Running away for dear life
* Getting ambushed while sleeping
* Dying of hunger and thirst
* Dying of arterial bleeding
* Dying of asthma attacks
* Being slogged so deep in depression they can't find the will to cook

Basically, everything is out to get you, and your worst enemy is yourself.

**What it's about**

You start by creating your character in a similar fashion to board games; distributing points between various stats (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Perception), skills (various forms of combat, mechanics, and chemistry, to name a few), and traits. Traits can be positive, such as being a fast runner or trained in a martial art, or negative, such as suffering from insomnia, illiteracy or obesity.

Aside from those, you get to pick a starting location from various scenarios, such as an evacuation shelter, burning building, crowded hospital, or in the middle of the forest. There's also a wide range of professions your character can start as, providing equipment (or lack thereof), and skills; professions such as: handyman, starting you with a set of tools and some surface-level knowledge of DIY, to a bonafide blacksmith capable of forging blades if given the workshop; on the sci-fi end of the scale you have cyberpunk-style bionic assassins and supersoldiers.

After creating your character, which would be pretty interesting to liken them to yourself as much as possible, you're plopped into the infinitely procedurally generated world with only one goal: survive as long as possible.

The game follows the theme of brutal realism. That is, 3 weeks without food, 3 days without water, and 3 hours without shelter. While the game *can* start in winter, the default is set to around halfway through spring. You won't be dying of cold until the sun sets and you need to sleep; however, your first priority should still be finding a safe shelter, away from immediate threats such as zombies or other mutant/alien/normal forest creatures out for blood.

Assuming you ran away from the business of the city and made your way to an abandoned cabin/shelter in the forest that's free of rutting moose (yes, animals have breeding cycles and they can get very aggressive), your next priority should be obtaining drinkable water. You can live off of bottled water for a short while but you need to sterilize your own. Fortunately all it takes is a container that can take heat, and some water from a puddle or whatever. You can boil water anywhere from an aluminum can to a 50 gallon drum. If you don't happen to have an efficient boiling implement, you can painstakingly make your own, provided you have access to clay near a river, a shovel, as well as the skills to match. Speaking of matches, you'll need some of those to start a fire, or a lighter, or your glasses if you have a pair of bifocals and it's sunny outside.

After securing water, the next step would be food. Depending on where you settled, you might find some food or ingredients in the fridge (which you might have to eat raw if you don't know how to cook), or some government-issue protein rations. The rations are sturdy and filling, but they're bland and tasteless; they'll literally make your character sad if you rely on them.

Say you're getting pretty stable: you found a lonely cabin near a river, made your own clay pots to boil and store reserves of clean water. You've probably learned how to fish, hunt and butcher. Unless you have a background in a profession related to killing/chopping up animals, your first few hunts will end up with a lot of unusable meat. Again, brutally realistic.

What next? Well, the Blob that caused the zombies to appear in the first place also mutates them over time. If you live peacefully off the grid for too long, you're in for a tough time should you revisit busy areas. Weak, slow zombies would have mutated into the runner type, and the runners would have mutated into some other monstrosity; it gets worse as time passes. That's why it's important to be able to fight.

As mentioned before: in this apocalypse, you're the prey, not the predator. This applies especially at the start. If you start as a blackbelt (which is unlikely if you base the character on yourself), you might be able to pummel some Z's with your bare hands. More realistically though, you'd need a weapon. And boy there are a *lot* of weapons. 

First of all, you can use anything as an improvised weapon; pick up a toaster and crack them over the head with it! A better idea, though, would be a bludgeoning weapon with a handle, such as a crowbar or a simple stick. Perhaps when you can hold your own better you can exercise with knives and other bladed weapons. Yes, katanas are a pretty viable weapon in this game (if you're a blademaster), though you might want to carry a sturdy backup.

Guns! Imagine having an apocalypse without guns! The game is set in the US, need I say more?  With enough ammo, you'll be able to take out the toughest of foes. I'd often recommend against it because they're loud and attract unwanted attention.

Arguably the best part about the game? **Mechanics**. With enough materials, tools, and skill, you'll be able to turn a shabby hatchback into an armored spiked death machine that can mow down hordes. Or perhaps you'll go lightweight and motorize a shopping cart? The choice is yours.

Chemistry allows you to make mundane stuff like lye and soap, as well as biodiesel for your homemade generators. You'll need those generators for stuff like charging a phone, a powerdrill, a homemade electric car, and much more!

This game is incredibly open-ended; you can be a small farmer in the middle of nowhere, a mad-max style driver, a horse riding forest-dweller and much more.

Things people forget in the case of a zombie apocalypse,"Here is a list of things people always forget if a zombie apocalypse really happened

0. Dont underestimate the government. If an epidemic were to happen, the government can deploy special forces to erradicate zombies. In the movie, we often see governement collapsing but unless the zombies are super duper hard to kill, the government will likely not collapse easily. You will probably be fine.

1. Waste management. If you live in a group of 10 people, you will have at least 40 pounds of shit every week. And that's not including urine. Have a system of proper disposal.

2. Learn how to grow fungus. If you can find a semi permanent shelter, learn to grow mushrooms. They dont require a lot of care like sunlight and they grow fast. You can have an unlimited supply of mushroom if you know how to re-grow them. Also you can use your poo previously stated to make compost and allow your mushroom to grow in it. You wont even require dirt. If you have the choice, choose fungus over plants.

3. Bugs. Flies and mosquitos can spread the disease faster than the speed of light. A single bite and you're dead. If you can, find thicc clothing and something to cover your face. A hazma suit would be ok but you have limited mobility. Try to relocate to somewhere with little to no exposure to bugs like around the arctic. If you have a safe house, make sure to not let any bugs in.

4. Roddens. Basically the same thing as the bug problem. Try to move away from cities. 

5. Drinking from a fresh water source might be tempting but the water could be infected. Any water source like rain or even snow could be infected. Always boil for at least 15 minutes. You can also add a drop of bleach for every gallon of water and let the water sit for a day before drinking for extra protection. I heard that it can decontaminate the water. 

6. If someone in your group gets bit in the leg for exemple, cutting it off wont save them. Infections travels trhough the blood. Just kill them on the spot. 

7. If you get back to your group and you see either you or someone with a new scar, treat the wound and quarantine them for at least 2 weeks if you can. You dont know if the virus got in or not.

8. If you find a store or a camping site with supplies, only take what you need. You give the chance to others to get things they might need and plus you may return at a later date. 

9. Always have goggles and gloves ready. If you come face to face with a zombie and you choose to use a melee weapon, fluid can spash onto you. Be careful to not let the fluid in any of your openings. 

10. Other humans are probably more dangerous than zombies. They can kill you and steal your stuff or strait up eat you. Do not trust no one except for the people in your group. Treat it like life in prison. Dont trust no one.

11. Canned food can expire but they dont go bad. If its properly sealed, canned food can last almost forever. Save them for emergencies. 5 year old canned tuna dont taste gokd but you cant get food poisoning by eating it. 

12. Some food have an unlimited shelf life. If properly sealed, honey, soy sauce, raw pasta and rice and some other stuff dont go bad. Like canned food, the taste might be off but you cant die from eating it.

13. Zombies do rot and freeze. If you're for the long run, just wait it out and every zombie on earth should fully decompose in 60 days at most.

7. if you get back to your group and you see either you or someone with a new scar, treat the wound and quarantine them for at least 2 weeks if you can. you dont know if the virus got in or not.

8. if you find a store or a camping site with supplies, only take what you need. you give the chance to others to get things they might need and plus you may return at a later date. 

9. always have goggles and gloves ready. if you come face to face with a zombie and you choose to use a melee weapon, fluid can spash onto you. be careful to not let the fluid in any of your openings. 

10. other humans are probably more dangerous than zombies. they can kill you and steal your stuff or strait up eat you. do not trust no one except for the people in your group. treat it like life in prison. dont trust no one.

11. canned food can expire but they dont go bad. if its properly sealed, canned food can last almost forever. save them for emergencies. 5 year old canned tuna dont taste gokd but you cant get food poisoning by eating it. 

12. some food have an unlimited shelf life. if properly sealed, honey, soy sauce, raw pasta and rice and some other stuff dont go bad. like canned food, the taste might be off but you cant die from eating it.

13. zombies do rot and freeze. if you're for the long run, just wait it out and every zombie on earth should fully decompose in 60 days at most. once zombies found their last victim, and there is no one else to infect, just wait it out."

a few useful techniques,"if you dont have a screwdriver, try to use a knife blade instead

&amp;#x200B;

use an axe, because it can be turned around and used as a hammer.

&amp;#x200B;

if you need to give a child who cant use a gun something, go for a hatchet. the miniature axe for smol beans

&amp;#x200B;

dont use a zombie go boom ivan head. just decapitate a zombie or tear off its jaw. then tie it to a tree.

&amp;#x200B;

dont trust the movies. these would be before an appocalypse. we dont know what they would be like.

&amp;#x200B;

If youre leg is bitten, isolate yourself in a locked room, tie off the bite, and amputate the limb. this would have to be done within about a minute of turning time. (ps dont accualy try this one)

&amp;#x200B;

go for a tool used for breaking strong materials, like a pickaxe.

&amp;#x200B;

**Machine Guns**

The military has guns, countless varieties of guns, which spew out bullets at a few hundred rounds per minute. The most famous imagery from WWI was of hapless infantry charging machine gun wielding defenders, and being mowed down. Just do the same to the zombies. I don't care if their undead or not, bullets shattering their skeletal system=no more moving.

**Tanks**

Go and try and bite and claw at a tank. Yeah, have fun. These vehicles are zombie proof. Just use the various cannons and machine guns on them to destroy the zombies. Canister rounds (imagine a shotgun shell but fired out of a tank) would fit the bill as an anti-zombie weapon. Even your average IFV or APC should hold up pretty well to zombies.

**Aircraft**

Zombies can't reach them. Just get an A-10, and have them BRRRRRRT the zombies into a thin red paste.

Mix a 5-1 ratio of oil and fuel in a bottle of your choice. Then, plug the hole with a wick of sorts, possibly a rag. Make sure the wick is soaked in fuel to make it flammable. One done, light it up and chuck it at your target.

Modifications:

Use motor oil instead to get a thicker, longer burning fluid.

This moral question in play,"This is a moral question that is always in my head at the beginning of any movie/tv show I see. 


At what point do people start knowing that they HAVE to kill what is attacking them? 


I understand completely that if someone is attacking you, you will do your most to defend yourself, at least I know I would anyway. But, thinking about it, I am in a society where killing is very frowned upon. Mind you, thinking about how you wake up on a normal day, everything is fine, then people start acting weird and you get attacked by someone. I get that zombies being alive will be a normal thing eventually and you won't even bat an eye at smashing some skulls in, but in the beginning when you woke up in a normal day, how do you think people know WHEN they have to kill. 

I'm just interested, because me as a person, even if being attacked by a crazed person, a real life zombie apocalypse wouldn't even cross my mind, so I wouldn't kill the person, unless I felt as if I couldn't stop them from killing me, ie, running away, knocking them out, or even screening for help. I think if I were in that situation, it would definitely take me a while to actually kill a zombie.

A Make Shift Slingshot as a weapon?,What do you think about makeshift slingshot as a weapon to silent the undead? I think it has the abilities of silence and unrestricted ammo as a perk in an apocalypse.,1,1620409661,ddos_Burma12,8,1,True,2021-05-07,a make shift slingshot as a weapon? what do you think about makeshift slingshot as a weapon to silent the undead? i think it has the abilities of silence and unrestricted ammo as a perk in an apocalypse.
Why should a bite be lethal 100% of the time?,"I think it's funny that in a genre where people are always trying to reimagine the zombie, very few people look at how the morality dynamics would change if some people recovered from bites.  I mean, there are movies where one person, or one family, is immune, and their immunity is a huge plot point of the movie.  But what about in a scenario where1 in 5, 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 bites weren't severe enough to transmit the infection, or transmitted so little that the immune system was able to prevent a full on infection? How then do you handle the bite victim in the group, when you know there is a decent chance they could be ok? 

It would make sense, especially in a Walking Dead scenario, that not every bite be fatal.  In TWD, everyone is already infected.  If you die choking on a piece of gum, falling off your unicycle or in the teeth of the zed, it all ends up the same.  Why then does the bite even kill you, if you're already infected?  Yes, the mouth is diseased and the bites lend themselves to secondary infections, but even then it shouldn't be 100% lethal. What about a bite from something that has the same contagion you already have makes it 100% lethal?

Even in worlds where the bite is the sole transmission factor, and you only come back if bitten, why is it 100%? Normal diseases don't operate that way.  In the current situation, I have heard of multiple households where some people tested positive for virus and some never did after weeks and several re-tests.  And even without immunities, very few diseases have 100% infection rate.  Where a person is bitten, how healthy they are, how much fluid from the biter actually made contact with the bloodstream...there is room for some variance in the results.

How do you think it would affect your approach to the apocalypse if there was a fair chance of surviving a bite, but the majority of people bitten would still die and turn?",1,1620436333,LiLadybug81,18,1,True,2021-05-07,"why should a bite be lethal 100% of the time? i think it's funny that in a genre where people are always trying to reimagine the zombie, very few people look at how the morality dynamics would change if some people recovered from bites.  i mean, there are movies where one person, or one family, is immune, and their immunity is a huge plot point of the movie.  but what about in a scenario where1 in 5, 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 bites weren't severe enough to transmit the infection, or transmitted so little that the immune system was able to prevent a full on infection? how then do you handle the bite victim in the group, when you know there is a decent chance they could be ok?

Island surviving tips,"what would be the first thing you do if you were on an island when an outbreak happened ? 

. Was wondering if anyone has given any thought about how to survive a zombie apocalypse on an island. I’ve been living in oahu for about 4 years now. Never really figured out a plan in case a zombie outbreak happened because I lived in the city for most of the time here. Figured I didn’t stand a chance then considering I didn’t have a car, food (starving college student), weapons, and lived on the first floor of an apartment complex with windows to the street. Anyways now I live away from the city and have a solid community of friends. I feel way more confident about surviving an outbreak here. Farming is good and as long as we have a good rain catching system we should be ok. Plus the ocean is nearby so we could get all our protein from there and all the wild boars. Another great thing is that as I write this I remember my friends house is essentially a fortress so that’s a good to-go place (the house I’m at currently is also mostly large windows). My main concern about my scenario are my weapon situation. Don’t really have much going for myself except for some knives, a spear gun, a big axe, and a bat.

My Zombie Survival Strat,"So, for this scenario, I will be using the logic of The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z. 

Basically, the first step is to notice the signs. Riots, increased violence, looting. Notice the signs and you prevail. You don’t and it’s harder, probably even impossible. I, or as an I a member of my family, would go out and buy foods, water, and other necessities. To add on we’d load up on Dog Food, a muzzle, and Bark Shock Collar. We’d warn all extended family and head to our Country House. Once there we’d sort out our weapons, mine hopefully being a crowbar, and filling every bathtub and sink, every cup and pan, every container and bin with water. We’d set up generators and invite some extended family close to us. As the zombies attack the unlucky will be stuck at their defenseless homes or in traffic jams as they attempt to go to their country homes or isolated cabins, but because they didn’t recognize the signs, it’ll be a whole lot harder.

"Most realistic ""zombie"" virus? WARNING: LONG THREAD","I'm passionate about virology , but if i post anything zombie related to their subreddit i will hate so i'm posting here

I've been thinking about the typical rabies but a different strain.

Characteristics:

Can spread from human to human more quickly

Incubation period varies more (typical is 1 to 7 days after bitten, rarely some cases where a month or more is needed) so in this new strain cases where incubation period takes longer aren't so rare but neither common

Can infect most mammals

The infected human/animal isn't scared of water or fresh air

Can be spread trough water (so it could easily infect the city's water system ) , bites , maybe aerosol form?

Infected humans drink any type of water, dirty , from puddles etc if they cant access clean water

When the infected humans are hungry they will commit cannibalism

The infected humans attack each other but dont kill themselves (kinda like the infected in l4d)

The infected eat whatever they can find if they are close to starving to death : trash , animals, rats, other non infected humans, they drink from puddles/dirty water/blood, they get to rest and they  are only in the rage mode when they see an uninfected human/animal, other than that, they rest so they wont die of a heart attack.

They get tired harder but can still collapse from running but it is harder due to adrenaline

Some are blind (assuming mutations that causes bloody eyes 

When an infected individual hears or sees something, it will go check in a jogging/walking manner , without it being angry, if it sees an uninfected human/animal thats when the adrelanine and rage kick in

When its cold they try to take shelter , so they still got survival instinct

They cannot feel pain and cannot judge

When an infected sees a non infected human it will attack  , one bite or two, spit at him, cough on him and hit him untill he either dies or is knocked unconcious (so the spread will be more complicated due to the infected killing some of their prey and not always leaving them alive)

But i got a few problems with this new strain:

1. To make it more dangerous (when it comes to spreading) i've been thinking about an airborne or aerosol form , so an infected person starts coughing or sneezing or vomit or spread it just by talking not necessarily coughing. But i dont know if these symptoms are possible to appear in rabies assuming this virus is made in a lab

2. Pack mentality

3. Its too specific, since rabies causes brain damage that leads to aggression i assume these concepts are too much

I may have missed some ideas , but i'm open to suggestions, rabies is definetely scary and interesting

Fallacies of zombie survivalist s,"Just a short list of common fallacies I’ve noticed over the course of many discussions on zombies 


An extra pound or three won’t hurt. This is one I’m guilty of, thinking that it will be fine to go with the slightly heavier item because you like it better. But it all adds up quickly and next thing you know you’ve got a 150lb pack. 


Infinite bullets. A lot of people thinks guns are the be all and end all when it comes to zombie weapons but assuming a full ZA bullets will run out, you’re going to need a back up. Besides you can only carry so many bullets(see above). Also guns are loud, they let everyone know where you are. 

Blades. Especially stabbing and slicing blades. They just are not effective on things that don’t die from blood loss, shock or organ damage. 

Baseball bats. They are not weapons. They are not lethal. 

It’ll look cool. Barbed wire, spikes and so on. Not help helpful, usually more of a threat to the one using the weapon. 

Over armored. Chain mail, plate mail, all that of that heavyweight armor that is way more protection then you’ll ever need versus the undead. 

Infinite gas / clear roads.  Cars and such will run out of gas and or break down without proper maintenance. Roads and highways will be clogged with vehicles that already have.

Zombies have Brain Decay =&gt; Shooting them in the head doesn't work. Brain decay from crazy nonsense info (zombie virus) is why they are zombies.,"Crazy nonsense causes loss of ability to reason much and brain decay. That's the zombie virus. Very old virus, as old as thinking itself. Impossible to completely cure.  Many outbreaks have happened many times. 4chan, Roanoke, Haiti, Aztecs, etc. We are all very familiar with the zombie virus as it always affects every thinking being somewhat.

Destroying the brain doesn't do much to zombies since they already have bad brain decay, and once they turn violent and flesh decaying, there's no reason at all to bother with the head because the rest of their body has already been struggling so much that it can probably function on its own and dig itself out of graves and shit.

Ok? So don't bother with the ""destroying the brain"" strategy. Decayed brain is *why* they are zombies.

If there was a zombie scenario to happen,"how long would it take to kill all zombies? I know it’s unlikely that anything zombie related will happen, but what IF. In movies/tv shows it’s always showing only one country (USA). What about the others? I don’t think that someone who’s got infected would randomly sit on a plane and infect others, because you would feel that somethings wrong immediately. Whereas with Covid you only show symptoms days later, so of course it can spread all over the world much easily.
Also, I don’t think that there’s going to be much infected people anyway, all will be killed of immediately by the military (i think that other countries will also help with the problem) before it can be widespread.

Fighting Tactics: Utilizing Assailant's Momentum,"Let's say that running/sprinting zombs exists. They pretty much run for anything considered prey, tackling them down and then proceeding to bite. Can we utilize their momentum for maximal impact against vital spots using reach weapons (spears, sharpened metal pole)?

Pro: high probability of 1-hit kill, low effort
Cons: high probability of weapons embedded in skull, difficult to use against multiple assailants, a slight miss means being tackled to death

What do you guys think abt this strategy? Is it viable?

This is the only way....,"So for years everybody has talked about a zombie apocalypse. Rather it be in movies, or video games. And for years i have loved to think about the what ifs. and what is best to do in those situations. Yesterday I was watching a video about Phil Schneider. He was explaining all the things people THINK are ""conspiracies"" but they are all true. At the time of the recording, it was 1995. And he was exposing facts about what they have planned for citizens. He said they wanted get rid of the population by 2029. That video was recorded in 1995 bro. And now 2029 is 8 years away... 

people need to realize who really rules this world. the elites rule this world. these are not opinions. This are not conspiracies. these are facts. people do not realize how many years they have had evil things planned. 50-100 years of full proof plans that are being achieved right in front of us. i was thinking about this for a few days. for years we have wondered what we would do in a situation like a zombie apocalypse. But we never ask who be at a disadvantage. 

The world is run by evil people. We all should know this by now. Especially with all this news and cover ups coming up. Yall can't deny this type of stuff anymore at this point. Im not sure people realize how long of a choke hold these people have had on our earth. Truth be told most of them are not even human. But thats to much for alot of you to understand. So I won't go that route. Bottom line is this. its only a matter of time before the real plans come out and there is nothing we can do. 

I mean come on guys. Almost EVERY thing we watched over the years was trying to tell us that high government is the real enemy. ""Yea but that's just tv. Its not real"" thats the point. Alot of independent film makers would put obvious real life scenarios on tv because everybody will think it won't happen. But there trying to tell us the truth. Remember the movie THEY LIVE? The director of that movie was told by elites to never make a movie like that again. 

Alot of stuff that is happening right now has already been foretold in the Bible in prophecy. There plans have been thought out for years. And everybody hating each other and being divided is helping them out even more. Makes there plans go threw even easier. Yall are to be busy fighting each other to see who the real enemy is.. then were gonna sit there and ask how did this happen. The government is the puppet master. Yall are the puppets. At the end of the day there is only ONE way we can even the playing field. Thats with a zombie apocalypse. If this were to seriously happen we would be a huge disadvantage. But for the first time in world history, the elites would be at a disadvantage Aswell. Thus the playing field will be even. For the first time.

 ""Why would you want that?"" When you have money and power they can do whatever they want to you. Of course i will put up a fight, but regardless they can do and take everything you have. If the president decided that you need to be in jail you're going to jail. There gonna arrest you and take you to jail. With no warning, warrants or anything. You could be killed or be put in jail just because the president ordered it.. these are facts. And everybody involved would keep there mouth shut or else they would be next. You think the mob is just for good movies? Lol this is the type of power the government has. 

The elites havs two things that allow them to rule this earth. Money and power. Same in other countries. NONE OF THAT matters in a zombie apocalypse. That is reason why it would be a even playing field. ""What about the military?"" They would probably be the first people to get infected. They have scientists in the military experimenting with stuff 24/7  It all will start in a lab. Kinda like now. Cov_id 19 was started in a lab. Just like so many other man made diseases. And people cash out on pandemics like this for money. Yea. They getting rich off you're pain. Let that sink in..... Not opinion. Thats Facts. Then you got people like b_ill g_ates who ""predicts"" world crisis on TED TALKS. And they make billions off this whole situation and depopulate the population at the same time. How obvious can this get honestly. With a zombie apocalypse it would be the same situation. But this time, there plan backfires on themselves and they dont have the upper hand anymore. A zombie apocalypse will not allow them to have world domination. 

All the rich people would not know what to do. They would be helpless. Crying. Fleeing. Probably trying there best to go underground. All those connections, money, power would all be worthless in a instant....... If a zombie apocalypse were to happen it has to happen by someone outside the government. They can't be in control of the outbreak. People will soon realize how much power these governments have. And they are gonna realize that this outcome is the ONLY way to even the playing field with them.

all the rich people would not know what to do. they would be helpless. crying. fleeing. probably trying there best to go underground. all those connections, money, power would all be worthless in a instant....... if a zombie apocalypse were to happen it has to happen by someone outside the government. they can't be in control of the outbreak. people will soon realize how much power these governments have. and they are gonna realize that this outcome is the only way to even the playing field with them.











i will send this to other places on reddit because i doubt anybody will share this honestly. so if you see this again im not spamming anything. just trying to get this out there to get people thinking...."

Would roller skates be an efficient form of travel in a zombie apocalypse?,"I have been wondering about this lately. Roller skating is faster and more energy efficient than running and walking.

I'm sitting here crying while writing this because I wish we could go back... so wish.

Whoever you are, if you're reading this, I'm obviously dead. Look down at my body... see me? My family will never know where I am or what happened to me. They're all alone now in this cruel, uncivilized and dangerous new world. I beg you, if you can find it in your heart, please find them and keep them safe.

my thinking is no matter what i’d want to never be more than send reach from a pistol, a knife, boots and some way to make fire. 

but when it looking for supplies i would take significantly more. any ideas?"

PSA: DON'T SMEAR YOURSELF IN ZOMBIE INNARDS!!!,"There are less dangerous ways to blend in. For example you could just act like a zombie!

Zombies almost certainly have duller senses than the average human, and the average human doesn't have the sharpest senses. Trying to blend in using smells is simply absurd. You should try to blend in using the sense humans are most reliant on, sight.

Simply moving like a zombie may be enough, though this tactic should only he used as a last resort. As you are essentially unarmed, unarmored, and in the middle of a horde of the enemy. A single sneeze could end your life. 

And if there are other humans around, blending in could end your life. So I'd recommend some kind of agreed upon signifier, like a colorful bandana around your wrist. 

In a worst case scenario don't grease up in guts, just walk/shamble slowly, take shallow breaths, and don't make any sudden movements. 

And if smell IS a concern, you can just use rotting meat from a non-zombie source such as rotting food, roadkill, or abandoned carcasses. Also, don't rub it on yourself, remove your clothes and rub your clothes in it.",1,1617861161,Pasta-hobo,20,1,True,2021-04-08,"psa: don't smear yourself in zombie innards!!! there are less dangerous ways to blend in. for example you could just act like a zombie!

Advantages:

They are sharp

I could use it for escape, for example if I am doing rough on food or medicine and I am surrounded by zombies I could use it to enforce myself when trying to climb

It is quite small, meaning I could outrun zombies

It is durable

Disadvantage:

When I meet a group or a person trying to steal supplies from me or just a group of people that do bad stuff I can't protect myself since most people choose ranged weapons.

"Face &amp; Neck protection from bites and, and from crushing force on the neck.","I'm thinking about what the most practical tools to have in the event of a real zombie apocalypse. For a weapon I've decided on a flanged mace as blunt weapons of this type seem to be the only things that can stop a zombie. If the head is smashed the zombie should stock functioning, if it's just speared or cut, it can continue attacking you, and then you can be overwhelmed once only one more zombie comes and puts it's weight on you or grabs a limb.

My next concern is body armor. I think that a zombie attack would be very similar to a chimpanzee attack. Since there is nothing to grab or pull off, the torso is a safe location and does not need protection. The areas of priority for protection are the face, neck, and arms. Arms can be protected by Kevlar or stab resistant sleeves. Arms will function even if bitten for a long period of time. The two needs here are 1. Facial protection while still allowing clear vision. and 2. Crush-force protection from bites for the neck.

The face will need some sort of kevlar type mask but also protection for the eyes. Zombie fingers, if they get on the face, will likely stab the eyes and penetrate right through into the head, like we grip a bowling ball. There needs to be eye protection from this. The other need here, as I said, is the neck. I am imagining that even with a Kevlar sleeve for the neck, a zombie can still crush the soft structures underneath it with a bite. 

If you have 3 zombies on top of you, and they're thrashing a way at you. Flailing and biting, you should be able to survive unscathed a few minutes if these two needs are met, and with one hand free and holding a knife, you can do damage to the zombies with a knife.

Without arm protection and the two needs met just mentioned, once you're down on the ground you will enter shock from your face being torn apart, and lose functionality from your arms being bitten.

Conflict with military group,"Its five months into the apocalypse, your in a group of 12 people (yourself included).   You've been on the road for six weeks when you stumble upon an overrun, but otherwise intact prison.   Because the fences appear to be intact and there was a military presence there prior, you and your group decide to take over the prison.   After clearing out the zombies, you put some people on watch and start taking an inventory of the prisons supplies.   You are part-way through your inventory process when you spot one of your people escorting a soldier to you.   

The soldier tells you the prison was quickly abandoned because it was attacked by a herd, but now that it has been cleared they want it back, making it clear he will not take ""no"" for an answer.   The soldiers tells you your group cannot stay, but he offers to let you keep some food and gas from the prisons supplies.   He tells you he will be back the next day at noon for your answer and leaves.   You order your resident expert on the military to follow him and assess their strength.   You finish the supply inventory and find the prison holds: 

\- Eight months worth of food and water 

\- An abundance of medical supplies 

\- Multiple firearms (16 automatic rifles, 22 handguns, 6 shotguns, 3 long range rifles) 

\- 20,000 rounds of ammunition 

\- Three military vehicles with mounted light machineguns 

\- A troop transport truck 

\- Three gasoline generators 

\- A tanker truck holding 5,000 gallons of gasoline 

All supplies are intact and functional.   

Your scout returns and reports that the military group has 22 soldiers, four military vehicles with mounted LMG's, and two troop transport trucks.   The military overall has fallen, and they hold no contact with other groups.   In your scouts expert opinion, the military group is well armed and will attack to retake the prison if your group does not surrender it to them.   Your scout also tells you that while he was returning, he spotted a group of 7 people sheltering overnight in an abandoned gas station.   He believes all of them are capable of fighting, and would be willing to join your group.   Overall, the prison is defendable and holds a lot of supplies.   

Your group is unsure on what to do, but universally believe there are three options: 

1.) Take in the smaller group and fight to keep the prison.   The prison is defendable, and the slight advantage the military group holds may not be enough for them to take the prison from you.   

2.) Accept the deal and leave with the food and fuel.   They outnumber you and have military training.   You would be back on the road again, but would have food and fuel.   

3.) Gather as much supplies as you can and leave before the military group returns.   They would have the prison back and may decide its not worth it to try and find you.   

You also believe co-existing with the military will not be possible.   There would be constant distrust from both sides, and they could kill your group or force you out once you let them in.

Melee Group tactics for physically weaker people( ie children),"So I have five kids, the young two of which are too young to be relevant here, the older three(14, 12, 11) are pretty solid athletic boys. But I wouldn’t bet any of them one on one with a zombie. Ideally they wouldn’t have to fight but sometimes things happen, one might get past the front lines or come in from the back. I’m mainly looking at a one at a time scenario, unfortunately if it’s much more than that then the chances aren’t really good. 

My thought would be arm the younger two with something akin to a boar spear. Basically a pole arm that has something in place to stop the zombie from walking up the shaft. A pitch fork might work. The third( most like the oldest) would have a light ax or something along those lines, preferably something with a little bit of reach so he doesn’t have to get too close. The idea would be the two spearers would hold it in place while the ax finished it off. It could also work with the spears tripping it up and the axe finishing it while it’s on the ground. That might actually give the axe a little more power as he can just swing like he’s chopping wood. The trip and chop might even work with a two man team. You could even stomp on the back of the spear shovel style to force it through a skull allowing a speared to finish it in a pinch.

What would be your plan/survival strategy to survive the zombie outbreak on Banoi?(Dead Island),"Let’s say in this hypothetical scenario you decide to travel to the fictional island of Banoi with family/friends for a refreshing vacation and then disaster strikes; a zombie outbreak has occurred! With your surrounding environment quickly deteriorating as the infection spreads what would be your game plan to survive this outbreak and possibly escape(flesh and family intact)?

Locations, geographical/geopolitical data, and zombie profiles will be listed below.

Location: The Island of [Banoi](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Banoi_Island) located off the coast of Papua New Guinea. The island is the largest and most populated of the [Banoi Archipelago](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Banoi_Archipelago). The exact population is unknown but I would put it in the millions at minimum, with the highest population density seen in the impoverished city of Moresby and luscious Banoi island resort.

   -Sub Locations: The [Resort](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Resort), the city of [Moresby](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Moresby), and the [Mingende Jungle](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Mingende_Jungle). There is also a populated [Prison Island](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Prison) that you will likely not find access to due to the surrounding minefield. 

Local Weather&amp;Geography: Weather is typical of IRL tropical islands: hot, wet,&amp;humid(this can cause quick dehydration). Rain showers are common along with larger storms such as monsoons. The island is largely unexplored and forested, with most urbanization seen along the coast and the populated capitol of Banoi, Moresby. 

Geopolitical situation: The Australian Navy has initiated a blockade of the archipelago and all flights in and out are shut down indefinitely. Military aid will be infrequent at best due to the chaotic situation on the island. The local [B.I.D.F](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Banoi_Island_Defense_Force)is very weak and won’t be of much assistance. 

Notable groups/gangs that will be prevalent post day 0 of outbreak: 

-Resort: [Lifeguard tower](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Lifeguard_Tower) and [Lighthouse](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Lighthouse) groups. 

-Moresby: [Saint Christopher’s Church](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Saint_Christopher%27s_Church) shelter,  [Town Hall](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Town_Hall) holdout, and the [Raskol Gang ](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Looters). 

-Jungle: [Afran Gang ](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Afran%27s_Soldiers), [river village ](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/River_Village), [laboratory survivors](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Laboratory), and a cannibal tribe. 

Now on to the zombie profiles. 

-[Infected](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Infected): This variant of zombie will be most commonly found at the beginning of the outbreak. The infection has just taking hold and there ability to sprint is intact. They are by far the most ferocious of the zombie types and often gravitate to small herds, waiting immobile for there prey. These zombie types are notably weaker and less durable than walkers however, and announce there presence with a bone chilling shriek. 

-[Walkers](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Walker): Slow shambling undead who have been infected for days-weeks. They are incredibly strong and durable, notably gravitating towards “herds”. A walkers weak-point is the head, but any mortal wounds will cause the creature to die. Walkers can uncommonly wield weapons as well, so watch out. You’ll only typically run into walkers days after day 0 of the outbreak because it takes time for rigor mortis to take effect. 

-[Thugs](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Thug): The Thug is a special,uncommon variant of the walker that towers over the undead and survivors alike. They display superhuman strength and enhanced durability, but can only move at a snails pace. It’s unknown what causes this mutation buts it’s speculated to be triggered by steroid use. 

-[Suicider](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Suicider): The Suicider is a very uncommon mutation which gives this specific undead type the ability to explode when close to a survivor. They can be commonly heard whispering “HEEELP MEEEE!”

-[Floater](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Floater): Floaters are zombie types only found in very wet/dirty locations such as the sewers and jungle. Their main form of attack is spitting corrosive slime on to there victims. They have durability on par with the thugs and are completely fireproof.

-[Ram](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Ram): The Rams have the size, strength, and durability of Thugs, but the speed and ferocity of Infected. The rams are all found wearing straight jackets which binds their arms to there chest, leaving only rams and kicks as attacks. These things are only found in the city in small numbers, but be warned as they don’t take kindly to survivors.

-[Butcher](https://deadisland.fandom.com/wiki/Butcher): Butchers are faster and stronger infected only found in the deep bellies of the Banoi jungle. They slash with their exposed forearm bones and have a powerful regen factor. Butchers are not to be trifled with.

-Infected primates: These are never witnessed in game but if the audio logs are canonical infected orangutans exist within the Banoi jungles.

Transmission: The virus is spread through bodily fluids(bites, scratches, blood, vomit) and asymptomatic carriers(anyone with a O- blood type).

I possibly just invented one of the greatest DIY zombie survival melee weapons ever,"So, i started from a simple idea, which is that in a zombie apocalypse you will sooner or later run out of ammo, blades will lose their edges (you can sharpen them, but it takes time and tools), so your best investment would probably be something like a baseball bat, but if the baseball bat breaks then you have to find another baseball bat, and that's definitely not easy.  
This led me to believe you need the perfect baseball bat, an indestructible, lightweight and extremely powerful baseball bat, so here's my ""invention"".  


You will just need a threaded stainless steel bar, some Loctite and threaded+knurled nuts.  
I figured you don't want the stainless steel bar to bend, otherwise it's going to lose its effectiveness, so it needs to be thick, but the thicker it is the heavier it gets, and you don't want to carry a barbell during a zombie apocalypse, so i figured a M16 to M20 diameter threaded bar will do the job.  


A 100cm long SS threaded bar in M20 diameter would whey around 5.5 pounds (3.5 pounds for an M16 diameter, same weight as a katana), which is reasonable, and it requires an insane amount of pressure to bend it (it's almost impossible unless you drive a lorry on it, same for the M16 diameter).  


You will then apply some Loctite to one end of the bar and screw the threaded+knurled nuts on it, that will be the handle. If you wish, you can also weld the nuts to the bar too so that it's really going to be a ""forever weapon"".  


Pros:  
Weight is reasonable/lightweight, it's virtually indestructible and you can build a new one easily in any hardware store, except for the handle it's going to be very thin, so it will cause a lot more damage than a baseball bat because it's going to apply pressure on a smaller surface (it's somewhere between a baseball bat and a sword), it's ergonomic as hell.  
Last but not least: it's badass.

Cons:  
All the cons melee weapons have in zombie apocalypse scenarios.

# Days into the outbreak : 1

As much as he wanted to continue sleeping, Felice (Yes it means happy in Italian, it’s a weird name) sadly had to wake up to the very annoying sound of his alarm. He specifically put it down so he would be forced to get up to turn off the loud sound. After about thirty seconds he finally gets up and turns off the alarm but not before shouting:

“*Dio cane*, I can’t take this anymore”.

He got down and turned on his phone, the light is bright and it takes him some time to get used to the light but after a few seconds he is able to read the notifications on his phone. He goes on the news section and reads :

    “Number of cases of rabies are rapidly increasing for no apparent reason, hospitals are filling up and receive more patients than they can handle” 
    “Heavy riots happen all over Eastern Europe and start spreading even more” 

Felice says sarcastically to himself :

“Jeez, can these news be any happier?”

He proceeds to open up Instagram and says

“*Sta’ stronza* is viewing my stories and liking my posts yet she still won’t answer my messages, what did I ever do to her?”

He proceeds to send a voice message to her, the recording said

“Hey bro, how are you? Are there any problems? I have been trying to talk to you for four days now but you still won’t answer, If there is a problem we can figure it out, anyways I love you”

She just replied with a dry text message saying :

    “I’m busy rn, I need time to think abt us, can we just have a break in our relationship? it just feels complicated” 

He then proceeds to go to school walking up that road he always goes, one of his friends says hi to him while going up an electric scooter, Felice says hi back but he envies the fact that he has to walk a long way up to school and has to carry all of this weight and has to make this *terrible effort of walking*.

A hospital seems to be almost full because of the very high number of patients infected with “rabies”. Three medics try to handle their patients the best they could but each one just keeps dying for no apparent reason. They also note that each patient has a bite mark or scratch wound. One of the medics sees a doctor wheeling in a close-to-death patient. One of the three medics complains :

“Are you kidding me? Again? Why is literally every person we treat infected with this new form of rabies? And what annoys me even more is that each guy wheeled in just keeps dying, and it seems like there is absolutely nothing we can do about that”

“Why do they keep sending people just to us? There are other hospitals in the world you know? We have passed our maximum capacity” says the second

The third medic just says : “Well it’s just life, look at this world it's just falling to pieces. Humanity is weird sometimes and more than always messed up.”

Suddenly screaming is heard from the other room, a young doctor in training screams and runs away

One person screams : “hey! You can’t just leave work like that, if you leave this facility I swear to god you’re fired!”

The medic in that room just stops for a while and shouts back:

“Fired my ass! Did you see what’s in there? I ain't risking my life in that room man, just look what is in that place”

The young employee storms off the facility and the three medics look at the room where he came from, they start hearing screaming and banging on the door

After he got to school a few minutes late, Felice rushes in late for biology class, with just a

“sorry for being late”

The teacher just looks at him telling him not to worry. He also said

“The test results came in, you got a 61%, your best grade so far, you are really improving”

As Felice sat down he said to his friend :

“Damn, my first pass, I feel so proud of myself”

Felice was a semi popular kid in class and he did fairly satisfactory in school. People were interested in talking to him because he could speak four languages and had some interesting stories to tell, so his friends were cheering him on for passing the exam. While he was enjoying himself for his “great” achievement, some girl in his class, disliked by everyone interrupted him and said :

“Excuse me, did I ask?”

Everyone started at the both of them and Felice just replied :

“Well I don’t care if you didn’t ask because the world doesn’t revolve around you, that’s why nobody shares their thoughts with you”

Alex said : “Yeah Sofia, you’re right, you just kill this vibe, what was even the point of this?”

The professor said :

“Well since you were talking, I assume you already know everything. Can somebody tell me the word equation for photosynthesis? You, Alex”

The teacher asked the question to a student called Alex, he was pretty smart in all subjects except biology.

Alex just said : “I’m sorry I have no idea”

Felice replied : “You absolute buffoon, the answer is Water + Carbon Dioxide with sunlight and chlorophyll make Oxygen and Glucose”

Felice was pretty happy after he got his answer correct.

The rest of his day went pretty decent if it wasn’t for the fact that his friend during lunch break came up to him and told him : “come see this you won’t like it though.”

He led him to the back of the school and found his girlfriend making out passionately with another person his age.

Felice just said : “Ah, what an interesting ‘break’. That’s why it wasn’t working, because you were too busy with him

She just said : “It’s not what you think, I promise”

“Well let me just say that we're done for good! You can go *andare a fanculo*, fuck you! I was gonna give you this ring as a gift to you but nah” said Felice enraged

He then turned around and said :

“Oscar, you really disappoint me, I thought we could trust each other, didn’t expect you to leave me to simp for her”

He stormed off angrily after flipping her off with a middle finger. One of his friends saw that he was upset and asked if they could talk about it. Cynthia was a really close friend of Felice and was a really kind person. She always secretly had a crush on him but never told him because she was too shy and he was in a relationship. Felice explained what was wrong but she just gave him confort.

IThen he said : “You really are a cool person, you are the person I can always open up to. Anyways, wanna play SCP Secret Lab with me tonight?”

“Yeah sure, hopefully my internet won’t start taking huge shits again” she replied.

“Yeah same, I swear to god though if you blow on that mic again i will go deaf. I don’t wanna be deaf.”

“Maaaaybe, and it’s a ‘maybe’ I won’t play horrible sounds on the VC again. Maybe i’ll be too busy escaping SCP-173 to ear-rape you”

He continued happily his day after he went home to play video games with Cynthia. He also invited some of his friends later on and it really seemed like that group was having a whale of a time playing that game.

While Felice and his friends were happily playing computer games in the warmth and comfort of their own homes, with very delicious snacks to eat while playing, a homeless man was unfortunate enough not to have any of these luxuries. His only “dinner” was three loafs of bread and a small bottle of beer. He would always waste the little money he got through begging on beer and strangely he seemed to be fine no matter how cold the nights were. At one moment he heard some groaning. He was quite drunk so he couldn’t really understand at first where the sound came from but later in the darkness he managed to make out a humanoid figure. The figure was one of the people infected with that “variant of rabies”.

The homeless man was brutally attacked and died very slowly and painfully. He was fully dead a few minutes later and the infected just left after he was done eating the homeless man. No one knew what happened.",1,1614705513,ILtuogiocatoremedio,21,1,True,2021-03-02,"my new story it's a bit like day by day armageddon except it's i third person. this is the story of the early days of a zombie outbreak that i will later be posting the next parts of. it shows the pov of a 15 year old trying to survive. the next stories will also show the pov of other characters # point of view

# days into the outbreak : 1

as much as he wanted to continue sleeping, felice (yes it means happy in italian, it’s a weird name) sadly had to wake up to the very annoying sound of his alarm. he specifically put it down so he would be forced to get up to turn off the loud sound. after about thirty seconds he finally gets up and turns off the alarm but not before shouting:

“*dio cane*, i can’t take this anymore”.

he got down and turned on his phone, the light is bright and it takes him some time to get used to the light but after a few seconds he is able to read the notifications on his phone. he goes on the news section and reads :

    “number of cases of rabies are rapidly increasing for no apparent reason, hospitals are filling up and receive more patients than they can handle” 
    “heavy riots happen all over eastern europe and start spreading even more” 

felice says sarcastically to himself :

“jeez, can these news be any happier?”

he proceeds to open up instagram and says

“*sta’ stronza* is viewing my stories and liking my posts yet she still won’t answer my messages, what did i ever do to her?”

he proceeds to send a voice message to her, the recording said

“hey bro, how are you? are there any problems? i have been trying to talk to you for four days now but you still won’t answer, if there is a problem we can figure it out, anyways i love you”

she just replied with a dry text message saying :

    “i’m busy rn, i need time to think abt us, can we just have a break in our relationship? it just feels complicated” 

he then proceeds to go to school walking up that road he always goes, one of his friends says hi to him while going up an electric scooter, felice says hi back but he envies the fact that he has to walk a long way up to school and has to carry all of this weight and has to make this *terrible effort of walking*.

a hospital seems to be almost full because of the very high number of patients infected with “rabies”. three medics try to handle their patients the best they could but each one just keeps dying for no apparent reason. they also note that each patient has a bite mark or scratch wound. one of the medics sees a doctor wheeling in a close-to-death patient. one of the three medics complains :

“are you kidding me? again? why is literally every person we treat infected with this new form of rabies? and what annoys me even more is that each guy wheeled in just keeps dying, and it seems like there is absolutely nothing we can do about that”

“why do they keep sending people just to us? there are other hospitals in the world you know? we have passed our maximum capacity” says the second

the third medic just says : “well it’s just life, look at this world it's just falling to pieces. humanity is weird sometimes and more than always messed up.”

suddenly screaming is heard from the other room, a young doctor in training screams and runs away

one person screams : “hey! you can’t just leave work like that, if you leave this facility i swear to god you’re fired!”

the medic in that room just stops for a while and shouts back:

“fired my ass! did you see what’s in there? i ain't risking my life in that room man, just look what is in that place”

the young employee storms off the facility and the three medics look at the room where he came from, they start hearing screaming and banging on the door

after he got to school a few minutes late, felice rushes in late for biology class, with just a

“sorry for being late”

the teacher just looks at him telling him not to worry. he also said

“the test results came in, you got a 61%, your best grade so far, you are really improving”

as felice sat down he said to his friend :

“damn, my first pass, i feel so proud of myself”

felice was a semi popular kid in class and he did fairly satisfactory in school. people were interested in talking to him because he could speak four languages and had some interesting stories to tell, so his friends were cheering him on for passing the exam. while he was enjoying himself for his “great” achievement, some girl in his class, disliked by everyone interrupted him and said :

“excuse me, did i ask?”

everyone started at the both of them and felice just replied :

“well i don’t care if you didn’t ask because the world doesn’t revolve around you, that’s why nobody shares their thoughts with you”

alex said : “yeah sofia, you’re right, you just kill this vibe, what was even the point of this?”

the professor said :

“well since you were talking, i assume you already know everything. can somebody tell me the word equation for photosynthesis? you, alex”

the teacher asked the question to a student called alex, he was pretty smart in all subjects except biology.

alex just said : “i’m sorry i have no idea”

felice replied : “you absolute buffoon, the answer is water + carbon dioxide with sunlight and chlorophyll make oxygen and glucose”

felice was pretty happy after he got his answer correct.

the rest of his day went pretty decent if it wasn’t for the fact that his friend during lunch break came up to him and told him : “come see this you won’t like it though.”

he led him to the back of the school and found his girlfriend making out passionately with another person his age.

felice just said : “ah, what an interesting ‘break’. that’s why it wasn’t working, because you were too busy with him

she just said : “it’s not what you think, i promise”

“well let me just say that we're done for good! you can go *andare a fanculo*, fuck you! i was gonna give you this ring as a gift to you but nah” said felice enraged

he then turned around and said :

“oscar, you really disappoint me, i thought we could trust each other, didn’t expect you to leave me to simp for her”

he stormed off angrily after flipping her off with a middle finger. one of his friends saw that he was upset and asked if they could talk about it. cynthia was a really close friend of felice and was a really kind person. she always secretly had a crush on him but never told him because she was too shy and he was in a relationship. felice explained what was wrong but she just gave him confort.

ithen he said : “you really are a cool person, you are the person i can always open up to. anyways, wanna play scp secret lab with me tonight?”

“yeah sure, hopefully my internet won’t start taking huge shits again” she replied.

“yeah same, i swear to god though if you blow on that mic again i will go deaf. i don’t wanna be deaf.”

“maaaaybe, and it’s a ‘maybe’ i won’t play horrible sounds on the vc again. maybe i’ll be too busy escaping scp-173 to ear-rape you”

he continued happily his day after he went home to play video games with cynthia. he also invited some of his friends later on and it really seemed like that group was having a whale of a time playing that game.

\- - - section cut - - -

while felice and his friends were happily playing computer games in the warmth and comfort of their own homes, with very delicious snacks to eat while playing, a homeless man was unfortunate enough not to have any of these luxuries. his only “dinner” was three loafs of bread and a small bottle of beer. he would always waste the little money he got through begging on beer and strangely he seemed to be fine no matter how cold the nights were. at one moment he heard some groaning. he was quite drunk so he couldn’t really understand at first where the sound came from but later in the darkness he managed to make out a humanoid figure. the figure was one of the people infected with that “variant of rabies”. the infected had a very big bite mark on his arm and had a very pale skin color, his eyes have lost their normal color and finally he was covered in blood with his clothes half-torn apart. the homeless man begged for money but he was too drunk to understand something was wrong with the man he was talking to. the infected figure rapidly approached the homeless man and pounced on him first biting his shoulder and then started eating his intestines. blood was gushing everywhere and the homeless man was screaming in agonizing pain but the only help he got was an annoyed man in a close by building shouting :

Something that not many consider when choosing a Gun for the Apocalypse,"Weapons that require a magazine to work are not viable for long term engagements against hordes of undead. Consider this scenario: You own a AK47 that uses magazines with a capacity of 30 rounds. You own a reasonable 10-20 magazines. That is a total of 300-600 rounds that you own. You own 3000-6000 rounds or more as a zombie apocalypse prepper. At any time, you can only have a total of 300-600 rounds ready to be used. If you end up facing a horde of let's say 150-300 zombies bearing down on you, you'd have to have pretty good aim to be able to kill them all before you run dry on magazines. You would then have to switch to a sidearm or reload the magazines by hand before being ready to fire again. The same problem can occur with clips for rifles like the M1 Garand, as loading it one by one is likely to get you Garand thumb. It is finnicky and troublesome, let alone under duress or moving. Shotguns are good, but dealing with a large horde from medium to close range is extremely stressful and cause you to make a possibly fatal error. Most people have never had to fire their gun in a stressful situation, with many not even going to the range consistently. Firing from a longer distance allows you time to calm yourself, take aim and correct your mistakes. Furthermore, 12 Gauge is a powerful round with a heavy kick making it harder for those with weaker physiques to effectively handle. I should know, the Kel-Tech my parents had me shoot slapped my shoulder hard!

For these reasons, I decided to pick a WW2 Mauser Rifle or Mosin Nagant with the option of installing a trench magazine as my weapon of choice. Clips can be used to load quickly, it doesn't need a magazine inserted to work as it has an internal magazine, and it is easy to load by hand when stressed or moving. Carrying 800 rounds and clips with it wouldn't be too tiring for a person with below average fitness, making it possible to retreat while fighting. They are extremely accurate at mid to long range and can be used for hunting as well.",1,1615299462,Butter_Raider,54,1,True,2021-03-09,"something that not many consider when choosing a gun for the apocalypse weapons that require a magazine to work are not viable for long term engagements against hordes of undead. consider this scenario: you own a ak47 that uses magazines with a capacity of 30 rounds. you own a reasonable 10-20 magazines. that is a total of 300-600 rounds that you own. you own 3000-6000 rounds or more as a zombie apocalypse prepper. at any time, you can only have a total of 300-600 rounds ready to be used. if you end up facing a horde of let's say 150-300 zombies bearing down on you, you'd have to have pretty good aim to be able to kill them all before you run dry on magazines. you would then have to switch to a sidearm or reload the magazines by hand before being ready to fire again. the same problem can occur with clips for rifles like the m1 garand, as loading it one by one is likely to get you garand thumb. it is finnicky and troublesome, let alone under duress or moving. shotguns are good, but dealing with a large horde from medium to close range is extremely stressful and cause you to make a possibly fatal error. most people have never had to fire their gun in a stressful situation, with many not even going to the range consistently. firing from a longer distance allows you time to calm yourself, take aim and correct your mistakes. furthermore, 12 gauge is a powerful round with a heavy kick making it harder for those with weaker physiques to effectively handle. i should know, the kel-tech my parents had me shoot slapped my shoulder hard!

My Rules I’ve made for Fast zombies type a.K.a infect you with blood,"Running away from responsibilities can  save opportunities.
Fight only in last resort, run away

No parkings available?
Looking for cars in parkings lot or around place can indicate the threat levels. The more the cars, the more the amount of zombies inside or around said buildings (why would someone leave their car behind, because they didn’t made it to their car in the first places) 

You gonna eat that? 
Even if the human body can survive without water for 3 days and food for 3 weeks , always eat something everyday, the body survives but the physical abilities won’t and good luck fighting anything on an empty stomach 

Do it now
Training , working out, learning, don’t wait for the undead to bash down your door to open a book, it will be to late. Learn all you need and put yourself in the best of your shape before everything starts and make sure to train with your weapon of choice. Even the sharpest blade is useless if you can’t wield it properly

Ever hear of Physics?
Don’t fight a zombie running towards you in melee. Even if you successfully hit it and kill it in one blow (by pure chance) his momentum wont stop. The dead body will pin you down. Could injure you with its weight, maybe even break a bone and if unlucky, it could Infect you from the blood pouring down
Shoot hit from far

Wear a mask.
Imagine getting infected because you bodied an infected and a drop went in your eye/mouth/injury. Would suck

Let’s race
Get use to your environment. Chances are the infected will catch up to you faster than you think if you run in a straight line. Instead practicing parkour and special way to get to point A to B rapidly to slow the zombies down with obstacles. They won’t stop running unlike you. So show them those moves. Don’t fall tho.

Noisy oopsi..!
If there’s electricity, there’s probably alarms systems.

Why would I go there?
If you need shelter for a night and don’t want to be seen by survivors or zombies. Go to the last place you would want to go like a gymnastics gym. Why would I go there??? That’s why, unless they want to jump on some trampolines, you’ll be alone for the night, just make sure the building is empty before you enter tho

even if the human body can survive without water for 3 days and food for 3 weeks , always eat something everyday, the body survives but the physical abilities won’t and good luck fighting anything on an empty stomach 

do it now
training , working out, learning, don’t wait for the undead to bash down your door to open a book, it will be to late. learn all you need and put yourself in the best of your shape before everything starts and make sure to train with your weapon of choice. even the sharpest blade is useless if you can’t wield it properly

ever hear of physics?
don’t fight a zombie running towards you in melee. even if you successfully hit it and kill it in one blow (by pure chance) his momentum wont stop. the dead body will pin you down. could injure you with its weight, maybe even break a bone and if unlucky, it could infect you from the blood pouring down
shoot hit from far

wear a mask.
imagine getting infected because you bodied an infected and a drop went in your eye/mouth/injury. would suck

let’s race
get use to your environment. chances are the infected will catch up to you faster than you think if you run in a straight line. instead practicing parkour and special way to get to point a to b rapidly to slow the zombies down with obstacles. they won’t stop running unlike you. so show them those moves. don’t fall tho.

noisy oopsi..!
if there’s electricity, there’s probably alarms systems.

why would i go there?
if you need shelter for a night and don’t want to be seen by survivors or zombies. go to the last place you would want to go like a gymnastics gym. why would i go there??? that’s why, unless they want to jump on some trampolines, you’ll be alone for the night, just make sure the building is empty before you enter tho

knock knock.
knocking. don’t need to explain it. they’ll come at the door. if not, no ones home"

Killing all Zombies or clearing a very large area,"Everyone likes to work really hard when thinking about clearing zombies, you need to think less hand to hand, and more tactically.

A very small group could clear tons of zombies for quite a distance setting up the following. 

Go to a large, long and high multi-support pillar bridge, the kind that spans a deep canyon / valley to fast water &amp; rapids below or down river.   


Think something like a the border crossing bridges just up stream from Niagara falls.

You blow out the bridge deck at both ends, then in the still standing and isolated fortress middle, you have a solar / battery powered sound system, think DJ style setup, sitting in the back of something waterproof like a transport or cargo container.   Less fun version, solar panels or battery keeps charging up a car alarm all day.

Most types of Zombies can't help themselves but move towards the sound... the sound echoing for miles down the canyon / water, they will walk off the edge of the busted bridge deck, or nearby canyon wall and fall to a bone/brain shattering splat and/or land in water being dragged away by nature (no body pile up) and eventually torn apart by rocks and other debris in the river.

The gear acting as bait is safe in the cut off middle of the bridge where the Zombies can't get to it to smash it... if you like living dangerously you could even camp in that middle area knowing nothing can get to you, and you kill the music for a half day when you want to rappel  or zipline out to do stuff.

Your team keeps mobile doing this on any bridge / canyon wall that makes sense to do it on.   Eventually you clear out an entire horde area to a manageable number to go hand to hand etc. as it's either the few that have not fallen in to your trap, or waterlogged, broken ones returning from down river barley a threat.

Is this a feasible zombie apocalypse?,"1. How to stop government instantly squashing it.

The infection starts everywhere. Perhaps a co-ordinated bio-weapon attack on water supplies across countries. Not likely but possible. Or a drug with unexpected side effects. It would need to be developed in a rush and rolled out quickly, but the Covid vaccine situation could be a good candidate.

2. How the zombies could work.

The virus causes people to become extremely aggressive (e.g. like Kingsman), also dulls their motor skills and even more so their general intelligence. But they still seek shelter and have some sense of self-preservation. Very similar to #Alive. That way they are still alive, not reanimated, and they don't just rot within a month.

3. How to ensure the zombies don't run out of food.

Plenty of people survive. It's the only way to provide a steady stream of new zombies. An equilibrium maintained between zombies and humans. It's difficult to get society to collapse if only 70% of people die, say, but I reckon that would be enough to get things to fall to shit, and everyone would be too busy with zombies to fix it. If not, you could have the previously mentioned terrorists starting this could do the classic 'EMP in Chicago' move.

Redirection devices,"In most zombie worlds they are easy to distract or redirect. Assuming these kinds are drawn to any sound or movement it would be very easy to aim individuals or herds in whatever direction you wanted them to go.

It would be easy to build a fence made out of simple rope or wire and rig a bell behind it so that whenever one of them walked into it the Bell behind them would ring and they would turn around.

The world is also full of those annoying little kids toys that have LED lights and make a lot of noise. If you simply carried a few of those you could throw them in directions that you wanted zombies to move in and just stand still while they went chasing after the toy.

Here's a more elaborate setup: 

You need a bunch of car batteries and car alarms  and enough wire to connect them all to your settlement located in the middle. This should all be easy to get. 

If you can get the remote starter or some other wi-fi/radio-controlled device you can get rid of The wire.

If you can get some small solar panels to keep the batteries charged then you won't have to go out there and recharge them every now and then. The good news is that according to a few quick Google searches even the most power hungry alarm can be powered by a regular car battery for  weeks of continuous operation.

The car alarms with all their noise and flashing lights are set up in a circle around your sanctuary. There are a few hundred yards away. If you have the resources you can put another circle a few hundred yards further out. Maybe even a third circle farther than that.

Once all this is set up you can basically herd a bunch of them away from where you're hiding.

Back to the simple and easy: 
If you build a little unlit campfire and set a whistling tea kettle with some water in it on top you could just light the fire whenever you needed to get away and the zombies in the area would crowd around that. Maybe they would even set themselves on fire attacking it.

it would be easy to build a fence made out of simple rope or wire and rig a bell behind it so that whenever one of them walked into it the bell behind them would ring and they would turn around.

the world is also full of those annoying little kids toys that have led lights and make a lot of noise. if you simply carried a few of those you could throw them in directions that you wanted zombies to move in and just stand still while they went chasing after the toy.

here's a more elaborate setup: 

you need a bunch of car batteries and car alarms  and enough wire to connect them all to your settlement located in the middle. this should all be easy to get. 

if you can get the remote starter or some other wi-fi/radio-controlled device you can get rid of the wire.

if you can get some small solar panels to keep the batteries charged then you won't have to go out there and recharge them every now and then. the good news is that according to a few quick google searches even the most power hungry alarm can be powered by a regular car battery for  weeks of continuous operation.

the car alarms with all their noise and flashing lights are set up in a circle around your sanctuary. there are a few hundred yards away. if you have the resources you can put another circle a few hundred yards further out. maybe even a third circle farther than that.

once all this is set up you can basically herd a bunch of them away from where you're hiding.

back to the simple and easy: 
if you build a little unlit campfire and set a whistling tea kettle with some water in it on top you could just light the fire whenever you needed to get away and the zombies in the area would crowd around that. maybe they would even set themselves on fire attacking it.

The ultimate zombie apocalypse meal plan (in a pinch),"Need some nourishment in a zombie apocalypse? Look no further than a few things: Honey, peanut butter, hardtack and a lifestraw. All three foods are nonperishables. Hardtack in itself can have a lot of calories, and lasts for a *long* time. Unfortunately, it tastes like shit. This is where the honey and peanut butter comes in. You can eat the peanut butter on it’s own, as it’s rich in calories, salt, and sugars. You could also use it with other foods. The honey is a natural sweetener, which could also help you with the taste of hardtack, as well as other less delicious items in the apocalypse. It also never expires. Like, ever.

Zombie outbreak timeline - hour by hour.,"Hi - I am writing a story - more of an hour by hour timeline (similar to the Sept 11 Timeline) - about a zombie outbreak. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, **in a real-life unforeseen national emergency, how fast does communication across executive offices, local and national enforcement travel from one department to another?**  


Suppose the WTC bombings occurred at 1:30 AM, when most of the top leadership is asleep, how many minutes would elapse before  the president, chiefs of staff, NSA, Dept of Defense would be in one physical location to discuss their plans?   


&amp;#x200B;

**Parameters**

The timeline is interspersed with eye-witness anecdotes from the law enforcement's point of view.   


* The outbreak has occurred in the capital of a fictional country of about 20 million people. 
* The Capital and seat of government has about 2 million residents. All of the Government apparatus (Departments, Bureaus, armed forces headquarters) are all located inside of and adjacent to  the Historic Walled City, but the top officials live elsewhere in high-end neighborhoods about 4 kilometers from the Walled City 
* The hospital where the outbreak occurred has 190 beds with 700 staff. The hospital is located near the city's entertainment district, so a lot of people are still having fun when the undead begin to escape the police cordon
* 1:39 AM was when Patient Zero started to reanimate and attack hospital staff

Choose your class!,"Here's a hypothetical list of assets. They aren't really balanced at all. Interested in what people think. What would be your top choices, and who would you absolutely not want?

Rifle hunter - Experienced at hunting and tracking with a rifle. Capable of killing game past 500 yards. Skilled at observation and glassing. Can clean, butcher and cook anything he shoots. Only carries 50 rounds at a time.


Hermit - Has been living in the woods for 13 years. Has created a shelter and small garden with yams and other root vegetables. Consumes mushrooms excessively, and is probably not stable.


Construction site supervisor - Has the keys to all the machinery, plus his leased ford F-350. Good at working long hours outdoors. Only two more years till his retirement. Concealed carries an unloaded glock, because he's sure he'll have time to chamber a round if he needs to. 


Bow hunter - Experienced at hunting and tracking with a compound bow. Capable of killing game out to 50 yards. Knowledgeable about animals and the wilderness, and is used to staying unseen. Can clean, butcher and cook anything he shoots. Only carries 10 arrows at a time.


College kid - Is always stoned, but is genuinely nice and very trusting. Will do dares for $1. Is always stressed about upcoming assignments, but never misses one. 


Renegade - Rides a sick motorcycle with a holster for  his sawed off double barrel shotgun. Has never actually shot it while riding, and doesn't know he can't hit anything with it. Has a cool mustache.


Gun nut - Has a wide variety of firearms, and is fairly proficient with most. Probably has a stockpile of amunition and tactical gear, but may be lacking in actual skills and real-world application.


Mall ninja - Has all the shiny gas station knives and weapons. Really big in to less lethals, so he has a stun gun and pepper spray. Has the heart of a warrior, but not the muscles of one.


Historical collector - Has a handful of old bolt guns from WWII, and prides himself on them having matching parts. Wears his period accurate Wermacht uniform on Halloween, and likes to get into arguments online. Actually a good shot, and has a good grasp and knowledge of historical military tactics.


Karate kid - Martial artist who has trained most of their life in a striking based discipline. Doesn't like to talk about it, but can perform a spinning side kick knockout. Watches a lot of UFC, but isn't arrogant enough to think it looks easy. Has excellent situational awareness, but is hesitant to use weapons.


The Top Gun - Has a private pilots license, and likes to rent out a Cessna 172 every other weekend. Quit the rat race years ago, and wears aviators everywhere. Only flies on nice days, and avoids crosswinds and gusts of more than 5 knots.

Cannivirus (Cannibal Virus) | Episode One - Initial Outbreak,"Location: Bar | Time: 11:47 | Virus Awareness: Unaware | Supplies: Alcohol | Weapons: Unarmed

You are in a packed bar with a few buddies. You've been there for approximately two hours, and one of them seems woozy, but not in a drunken way. He excuses himself to the toilets.

You crack a joke to the others about him being silly, because he's only had one pint. Just as you go to crack another joke, screaming is heard from the toilets, and someone is banging on the door from the other side. The whole bar goes quiet.

The bartender goes to investigate. He opens the door and your friend tumbles to the floor, having a seizure. There is blood doing his chin and shirt, and he has no history of epilepsy. The bartender grabs a cloth from the bar and goes to put it under your friends head. Your friend reacts violently, biting the bartender in the ear, and tearing it straight off. It doesn't take long before the bartender becomes aggressive and starts attacking people. Panic ensues.

There is a pool table nearby, with three pool cues, one of them being spare. There are several glasses behind the counter. People are tripping over each other and the ones who went to help are quickly succumbing to the bites they received. You see five infected.

*The infected aren't fast, but they're not the walking dead slow either. They move at a moderate speed.*

Rate my Z-day plan,"I have a pack of 30 MREs and 32 water bottles in my jeep at all times. Plus at least 4 cases of water at my house and roughly 50lbs of canned food (beans, chili, tuna, chicken). And I never let my jeep under 1/2 tank. I live in a fairly large metropolitan area, but on the extreme outskirts of said area. I work as a commercial pilot flying smaller aircraft (C208B, DHC-6).

The aircraft has roughly 9hrs of fuel when topped off and cruise speed of 165mph.

I then proceed to fly roughly 45mins to a ranch in Arizona. The ranch has an airfield, small fuel depot with jet fuel and mogas, solar and generator power, 10-15 4wheelers, 6-10 Polaris ranger type vehicles, 3-4 buildings with roughly 40 bunks, 6-8showers, and its own internal water supply.

A story for the ages,"Hi im going around reddit to any zombie subs, and Im writing a book, I need a name for the book and some other Ideas The book is a journal from a survivor

 

Day 1

Date 5/17/2017

The first day of the rest of our lives. The bomb had been dropped, we had no idea it was going to happen… but it did. Damn them, they have no idea how many people they killed and how many more they will have over the next 20 years… The only reason why that is possible is because their “Bomb” didn’t just blow up, it released  a cloud of green gas, there was no explosion… but that's how it started. All of a sudden there’s tons of these… Creatures. But they weren’t normal, they didn’t talk and all they would do is eat. But not normal food, they’d eat humans. 

Day 2

Date 5/18/2017

I followed three main rules while I was out of my survival base,

1. Unless you know them don’t talk to them
2. Check for bites, if they have a bite their head comes off
3. Don’t let anyone get too close to you, you don’t know what they may have for weaponry

Damn it, the rules aren’t that hard to follow but one of the survivors I was with, Damn! I told them the rules, but they didn’t listen. Now they’re dead.

Day 3

Is night a good time to travel,"I remember seeing some people talking about how danergous it can be to travel in the night, talking about how hard it is to detect zombies, fight back, and run in the night. I mean they do have a very good point zombies can easily sneak up on you and if they bite you, you're just dead. Even though all these things are true, I could also see some advantages to it, zombies are pretty much humans that are dead or infected with a pathogen that makes them want to kill every living thing painfully, so assuming they don't evolve or mutate they'd have the same eye sight, earing, and smell as us making them pretty easy to avoid since our eyes weren't designed to see in the dark, of course your eyes can adjust but that may take a while and you still won't be able to see things sometimes if it is too dark. Plus there eyes could be messed up since they are some of the quickest things to rot away in dead creatures or will probably be eaten by whatever virus is causing this, but that can be debated since zombies aren't actually real. Now of course I wouldn't travel at night with just my eyes that doesn't seem to be as useful as it is deadly, but if we look at the prices of survival gear the cheapest night vision goggles that came up with just a quick search through DuckDuckGo found a hand held one which costs $169.99 USD, tax is probably not included. Then I found a nice one that attaches to your helmet, so you can have head protection and only covers one eye so you don't get suddenly blinded by bright lights, that one was $269.99 USD again not including tax, so only 100 dollars more, so you aren't breaking the bank if that ZA you planned for sadly never happens and still it can be used for other things like if you like to hunt or camp, or you need it for other disasters. With a good pair of night vision goggles you have so many advantages when it comes to survival, you can easily travel/sneaky around without be noticed by both zombies and other humans in case they are like raiders, since you hidden by the cover of darkness. Ylu get a tactical advantage since you're the only one who can see them or other things. You can loot buildings way safer since they probably wouldn't have power. You can use it to hunt animals more effectively than in the day. It may also provide a bit of protection to your face, not much since it wasn't built as armor, but better than nothing, so I guess it is like a passive bonus. (You'll still probably be done for though if you allow them to get that close to you, if we'rebeing realistic. ) Not to mention all the other uses that they provide to you.

Let's talk flashlights,"What do you all think of flashlights?  I haven't seen a lot of mention of them here, and I think they're invaluable. Beyond that, does anyone have specific types they recommend?

All my good flashlights are olights, small tactical lights with good lumens and throw. I carry the m2t warrior as my edc, and a pl-mini 2 on a pistol. Until recently I had an m20sx javelot on my maverick 88 with a pressure plate activation, but I kinda stripped down that gun of all it's flash, so now the light is on my plate carrier. 

The javelot and warrior take 18650s, and I have 4 rechargeable ones that I've been rotating for a few years. The pl-mini2 is magnetically usb charged, so it's easy to top off. The 18650 charger is also usb charged, so I can charge from my car, or a solar setup if I ever get around to that.

I can solidly recommend any of the above lights. 

In an apocalypse, it might be better to have a flashlight that takes common batteries, but generally you're then sacrificing power and lumens.

The main light that I'm lacking is a solid headlamp. I have an okay one, and one absolute dogshit one. I cannot overstate the importance of having both hands free, and still having light in non tactical situations. I'm talking making a fire in the dark, making a shelter, loading a magazine, or any number of tasks that suck without two hands and light. 

I think people might automatically go to 'a maglite would be the best in a ZA cause you can brain zombies with it.' Sure, but I personally wouldn't want to risk the longevity of a main tool like that. I wouldn't use it as a hammer, so I wouldn't want to use it on zombies either. Not to mention having zombie blood all over it. 

I'd also think it wouldn't attract zombies, unless you shine it right at some, in which case you'd probably be glad you did, or just don't do that.

What do you guys think? Do you carry flashlights? Do you have some in a kit? Good idea? Bad idea? 

Also opinions on weapon mounted vs handheld lights? Like I said my pistol has a light on it, but that's more of a backup. Is it worth a sacrifice in a good two handed grip for a handheld light? Long gun mounted lights are cool too, any thoughts on that?

Ladders!,"In urban environments the ability to access flat roofs as a safe sleeping place might be a real advantage.

Do bug out bags actually make sense?,"In a zombie context. In this case I'm specifically talking about the 72 hour sort. While a zombie survival bag has a lot of overlap with a standard 72 hour bag, my proposed issue with a 72 hour bag is I think a zombie survival situation is far less predictable; there is no guarantee that you can actually get somewhere safe in three days and even then, so guarantee that your safe place has food. 

Important differences in my opinion:
Basic tools like a hammer, a screw driver, nails and screws should be kept in a zombie bag; when you reach a safe place you may need to fortify it.
Foil blankets can't be used as liberally with zombies, they're too loud. They're tiny so keep one for an emergency but I don't think they can be the main option
It could be that more food is required. 

These things would add a lot of weight.

Uses for dead zombie bodies,"Imagine you have a shit ton of dead zombie bodies everywhere and you have no use for them well i have some uses that are epic

Use them to make other zombies think your a zombie unless they know what's and what's not a human differently 

2.Markers

Pile up dead bodies around somewhere and use the head as an arrow tip to point somewhere it's not like a zombie will have the intelligence to know its an arrow


3.Base borders

If you put bodies around the edges of your base it will mask the smell 

4 (short term). Smell practice

Rotting flesh will obviously smell terrible so you can get nose deep into those bodies to get used to the smell

5 (need blood in the zombies). Sabotage

get zombie blood in the victims water supply so then either they get infected or notice the blood and then make them search for more water and possibly get infected along the way

6 (need blood in the zombies). Infecting yourself???

Theoretically surviving means not dying so that means turning into a zombie can still count as surviving.

Please the majority or the minority?,"Scenario:

Recently, a small group (16 people) steal supplies (for the sake of the scenario, let’s say that they stole ALL of the remaining supplies the group has) from the group. (The group is large, made up of 115 people including the 16)

Soon, you and the majority ( the 99 remaining people) hunt down and take back the supplies from the minority (the 16 people)


When the majority of the group meets the minority that stole, the majority is demanding that you kill the traitors.

If you kill them, the majority will be pleased and will respect you more as well as being more loyal and will have a less a chance of betraying you (aka repeating the whole scenario)

If you let them go, the majority will be angry and lose some respect for you and be more likely to betray you (or steal and flee just like the minority), but the minority will go free and tell other communities and lone survivors that you were merciful (which would lead to more people joining you, and other communities being more willing to trade with you)

2. The house is a 2 storey concrete building. No balcony and we large glass windows, one of which is a sliding floor to ceiling window. We have a feel which feeds a water tank which is powered by a pump. We're on the grid. We live in a suburb near the city.

Diabetic Dystopia,"So say a zombie apocalypse does unfold (you know, just hypothetically), I'm pretty sure I as a type one diabetic wouldnt last very long at all.

 I would try and stock up on my insulin cartridges as best as possible but I might only have enough for half a year. With all the factories presumed closed and abandoned the supply of insulin will stop, and all that would remain would be the small amount left in pharmacy fridges around the country. And even then with no power to supply said fridges the insulin will start to break down and become unusable.

Sanity and cleanliness,"A while back someone made a post which had a bunch of \*comfort items\* as people said.

I argue against them being comfort items, most of them are required to keep basic cleanliness, which is really important, especially when most doctors and dentists are dead. It can also prevent you from catching preventable diseases. 

I have made controversial and bad posts and arguments before, but this one takes the cake:

it think the 3ds is good to keep, if you have settled down with a group, if you found a way to power it.

Along with using the notebook as a diary, both can help with sanity and anxiety, which i argue is really important. You cant kill zombies if your batshit crazy. If im alone i woudnt use the 3ds, because i have things to do, i would have the diary though because it help so much, especialy when your alone. But if im in a group and we have settled down, we do things faster so we might have a bit of spare time, thats when i would use the 3ds (if i can power it) or socialize. Yes being with other people helps more, but every little bit of sanity counts.

Diaries also help with anxiety and other problems.

Yes i do have a 3ds BUT HEAR ME OUT

sanity is really important in a ZA, i argue its just as important as food or shelter, thats why every little bit counts. Be it surviving with friends, 3ds, diaries or pets, sanity helps a lot.

Please dont ignore the importance of sanity, which is a really important reason to NOT go lone wolf. You wont last long in isolation, no matter what you think.

But if you have to, keep a diary or bring along a pet, or both, it might just give you an extra week before you go insane from the isolation.

The zombie apocalypse is scarier than you think....,"Kinda piggybacking of my last post. But I think
The horrors would be deeper than just “zombies”

Humans- not everyone will be friendly. There could be drug addicts, rapists, racists, murderers, and people with metal illnesses that’s cause paranoia and violence. And the most heartless and hardcore would survive longer than the soft hearted

Total Silence- There are no cars or machinery or airplanes that make up the everyday hum of human activity. Any sounds that you made like driving or anything would be emphasized because there exists no other sounds but gunshots and the sounds of animals and death 

Medicine- Uh yeah that’s probably the first place people would raid because it’s the most important product. And since the hospital is gone many minor illnesses or stuff that could be catched early on can’t be. Therefore you and your loved ones could just slowly die from cancer or a tumor or something 

Food- Besides can foods and freshly grown food your fucked. Everything will get spoiled or rotten or stale and there will be mold

The Smell- Blood smells terrible and many productions really don’t focus on this aspect. How could you anywhere and have peace if your constantly smelling blood and other bodily fluids which brings me to

Bodily fluids- so I assume toilets are gone. So everyone is pooping and peeing in rando places and that smells gross. Getting your period would be a nightmare of non comfortability, cramps and bloating and emotions and all that especially if you have Endo or a heavy cycle.

Hoarders- you never know wtf is in someone’s house so while you scavenging you’ve come across houses with deep horde and Mabye you found a dead body or like child porn just weird shit that no one should see. Or live in

Feeling of death- and finally how does it feel to be ripped apart? Pretty bad I assume. 

PTSD- So I imagine we wouldn’t all be calm and calculated in a ZA. Some people would just go crazy. You would have to watch out for controlling dictators types. Not to mention you pretty much can’t trust anyone. Even if you were in group for a while, someone would easily turn on you and their goal was to be manipulative to steal resources. You never know how a human would react

Sex - Well uh can’t go get tested for stds. No ones hygiene is super up to par so. The stink of sex would mutate. If you get pregnant you can’t take medicine you can’t get checkups if their are ANY complications your just gonna die. How could you start a romantic relationship with someone who could die tmr. 

Interaction- there is always the possibility that someone is watching you or following you

Sanitation- because there are walking decomposing bodies and normal decomposing bodies you’d pretty much have to wear a mask everywhere because you have the potential to exposed to the deadly chemicals of a decomposing dead body

Wild Animals- lions, wolves, deer, any animals your name it. Is either dead and stuck in a cage or roaming freely ready to knaw on a human. 

Technology- Unless you a mechanic or can read well and apply it your Fucked my friend.

Boredom- I always thought that if I knew of a ZA coming I would download music and stuff on my phone. But what are you gonna do when the battery dies. Also you could never have the luxury of listening to music or entertainment because you must be aware of your surroundings and not bring attention to yourself.

Has anyone tried to drive a ford transit van off road?,"Or seen or heard people doing so? Regular two wheel drive versions. Less hardcore off-roading, more very muddy fields and other terrains you would expect while driving near/next to blocked motorways.

There’s math to the apocalypse,There’s something I’ve been thinking about figured I’d share with everyone. No matter what kind of zombie walkers runners ones that move by cartwheel there’s one rule 1 human = 1 zombie therefore if 1 human killed a zombie and then turns into a zombie there has been no increase on the zombies side the zombies have gotten no stronger and no weaker. So kill 2 zombies the zombies have lost 1. So following this train of though if you wanted to secure an area if you killed just 1 zombie a day (preferably more) then the area would become secure until more zombies wonder in.,1,1609899004,Coleblade,28,1,True,2021-01-05,there’s math to the apocalypse there’s something i’ve been thinking about figured i’d share with everyone. no matter what kind of zombie walkers runners ones that move by cartwheel there’s one rule 1 human = 1 zombie therefore if 1 human killed a zombie and then turns into a zombie there has been no increase on the zombies side the zombies have gotten no stronger and no weaker. so kill 2 zombies the zombies have lost 1. so following this train of though if you wanted to secure an area if you killed just 1 zombie a day (preferably more) then the area would become secure until more zombies wonder in.

Wednesdays Coup/Sedition Remind Anyone Else of the Final Rounds of Left 4 Dead?,"I have really bad anxiety and used to pour it into my zombie story, but then life got busy and I was called crazy for working on it.  Every single year that passes, those same people that called me crazy for thinking zombies could happen (especially after I'd explained that when I said ""zombies"" it was my way of blanket statement-ing any type of social unrest where hordes of people who were unable to think rationally) are now full blown conspiracy theorists or preppers themselves and started talking about these kinds of worries.

Like Zombieland I have a Code on how to survive a Zombie Apocalypse,"Give me tips or ideas for the Code 

 Everything Around You Is a Weapon: Imagine the Apocalypse started, you don’t have a gun, there is a zombie walking right in front of you, blocking the kitchen where the kitchen knives are. What are you going to do?. You can smash his head with a lamp, to stun him and grab a knife, you can stab him in the eye with a letter opener, or you can push him out the window, where he can hopefully land on his head and die. 
 
Stay Hydrated: Instead of Zombies, Water can kill you just as easily and painfully as a Zombie bite. You need to drink lots of water, and if you don’t you have 3 days to live without water. Find working water fountains, creeks, the top of the toilet, that may sound gross, but it is clean and you don’t have to worry about diseases. 
 
Guns Are Your New Best Friend: If you like to carry a baseball bat, or a knife for survival, you’ll need something in case shit hits the fan. You will need a gun and bullets. Make sure you don’t use all your bullets, your gun should always be for emergencies and if you are in an almost 100% chance of dying, then your gun is also your get out of Apocalypse free card. 
 
Don’t Go Out At Night: At night you can't see your companions and may accidentally shoot one. You also can't see the zombies. Yes, yes, I know you can walk very quietly with all your senses on high alert, but if he's leaning his half-dead self against a tree and doesn't animate until you pass by then you're a goner. And you should be.
 
Stay with your Group: Never wander off alone to contemplate the corruption of your companions, because that is precisely the moment when the hordes will descend upon you and eat your highly moralled brain. There really is safety in numbers so stay with your group.
 
A Decapitated Head Can Still Bite You: When you slice a zombie’s head with your katana or machete, it’s head is still alive, you have to destroy the brain, and the head’s are also a back up weapon if you are in a stressful situation with hostile survivors. You can use the head to bite and turn people into zombies. 
 Keep Track of Your Kids: If you have any kids, they keep track of them. Don't let your kids wander off. Eventually the group will turn on you when you convince them to risk their lives looking for your child. 
 
Not Everybody is Nice: Mostly in an Apocalypse people revert to an animal like instincts and can be cruel and most likely Psychotic. Not everyone you meet in the world you are currently living in is going to be friendly, but if they are truly nice and helpful stick with them. 

Make Sure The Dead Stay Dead: Most Zombies won’t die from one hit, so if they are still alive (or undead) then hit or shoot them again. 

Lighter’s are Better than Matches: Matches of course has multiple tries for light but Lighter’s are least likely to lose since they are heavier than matches and can only use one hand so you if you are looking for a lightswitch in the dark you can use a Lighter while holding a weapon. 
 
Swiss Army Is Better Than Your Average Knife: Besides being a multitool. They are also small enough and unthreatening enough not to attract the attention of the overly concerned. 

Clear The Room: There's nothing worse than stepping into a room only to be set upon by a horde of brain-hungry zombies. A team of four armed shooters can easily clear a room if they all stand against the nearest wall: one body in each corner and two in the middle. This position proves optimal for quickly dispatching a room full of the reanimated. 

Windows Are Not Your Friend: Zombies have a nasty habit of crashing through glass windows, so it's best to choose a hideout with as few ground level windows as possible. Steer clear of malls, coffee shops, and boutique outlets in favor of Costco, BJs, Sam's Club, or any other large warehouse. If you find yourself trapped in your house, it's best to hightail it up to the attic, which the uncoordinated zombies will have trouble reaching.",1,1610125173,Babywalker66,15,1,True,2021-01-08,"like zombieland i have a code on how to survive a zombie apocalypse give me tips or ideas for the code

"What should my plan be if the ZA happened, like right now?","Ive thought about it for years, and as a huge zombie fan Ive got plenty of theoretical ideas on surviving a ZA, but ultimately I dont know what my plan would really be, mostly just because of how useless I am. Im pretty sure I cant survive on my own, and would only be a burden to any group I join.

Situation: Im homeless, living out of my car, and stay in a dense urban area right outside a major downtown city. I have no friends or family to go shelter with. I stay right next to both a walmart and a lowes, so I can make a mad dash for supplies if needed.

Physical ability: Im seriously overweight (300 lbs), with no physical fitness at all, i get winded after just a quarter mile walk and can only run for about 100 feet before getting exhausted.

Supplies: Car, basic winter clothes. No weapons, no tools, no stocked up food or water. $400 in food stamps, $400 in bank.

Survival skills: None. Have some basic theory, like I technically know how to start a fire or build a leanto, but have never actually tried or practiced. Have never hunted, fished, or foraged.

Would nerve gas help in a z apocalypse?,"In most Zombie movies the brain is still active to a certain degree which is why you have to destroy it.
So if the zombie apocalypse would be caused by a virus a nerve gas could do the job right?
If that's the case then it would make sense for the government anounce that, drop gasmasks in the infected zone and to gas it after a certain period of time . You wouldn't have as much damage to buildings and the army could take care of the remaining ones when the gas fades.

Reasons why firearms are better than melee weapons in a zombie apocalypse,"1. **Long Range kills**\- You don't have to run close to the zombies with a...machete or a katana (&lt;ridiculous weapon by the way) and slowly hack them to death super close. You simply point, pull trigger, rinse and repeat.
2. **Kills zombies faster**\- A blast from a rifle or shotgun will blow a zombie skull to itty bitty fragments, and even a pistol can pierce a brain. You guys who use melee will have to expel precious energy swinging or slashing while I can just pull a trigger and no more zombie.

Counter claims and rebuttals

1. **What about ammo?**\- Literally just scavenge some more. In America alone, 12 billion rounds of ammo are produced. A year.
2. **Noise**\- So what? Even if it attracts zombies, you can just run. And no humans are gonna go towards the sound of a heavily armed survivor shooting. So you're safe.

Pet dogs. What would you do with yours?,"This is something I have often wondered, and have had nightmares of more times than I can count. Usually in my zombie-themed nightmares my dogs have neither a collar or a leash, and my greatest fear is losing them. Come the Z apocalypse, what would you do with yours? 

For the purpose of making things a little simpler, let’s assume that in this scenario that dogs can not turn, but only die. 

Would you set them free? This entirely depends on your size/breed of dog too. I’m assuming someone with a Yorkie might not want to leave their dog to fend for themselves. I personally have 2 pit bulls, and I can assure you that my dogs would *literally* die for me. This is why I wonder if setting them free to protect themselves and not me would be the more humane, I-truly-love-my-dog option. 

But if I’m being selfishly honest, I don’t believe I’d be able to let them go (considering they’d even run away). I believe come the real thing, at least for a while at first, id attach several belts around my waist with the hand loop of their leashes tethered through the belts. I’d then attach the leashes to their prong/“choke” collars (that do not actually choke them, they literally choke less than a normal collar on a leash with a pulling dog) because they are the sturdiest, made of metal, and they actually rub at their skin/fur LESS than fabric collars do. 

The dogs attached to my waist would provide several pros- such as not losing them, or even potentially dragging my unconscious body to safety. It would promote several cons as well - like them pulling towards zombies, or notifying zombies of our location. However back to depending on the dog, my dogs aren’t barkers, they are growlers, and in general a very silent species compared to other dogs. Still, it’s the best thing I can think of, if I want to keep them.

Optimal zombie killing team of 5 people,"Alright, so after thinking about it, I think I know the perfect weapon loadout if you have a team of 5 people. 

2 people should be outfitted with long range rifles, preferably something like an AR-15 or AK-47, and would be designated to taking out zombies from long-range; preferably they'd be outfitted with some type of small handgun for emergency situations as well.

1 person would be given a shotgun, preferably a pump-action like a Remington 870, although a double-barrel shotgun could be bearable in absence of one. The usefulness of a shotgun is not only it's ability to fire multiple rounds at once, making it a good horde suppressing weapon, it also would be good due to its ammo (12 gauge shells) being extremely plentiful.

Finally, 2 people would be outfitted with melee, of course. An ax and or machete would be good for taking down zombies in small amounts, especially when you want to preserve as much ammo as possible.

I’ve been writing a bunch of ideas I’ve had about making zombies more of a threat in movies. I’ve now made my very own type of zombie.,"This is based on lots of different zombie and zombie like movies, books, shows and whatnot. I’m just gunna write the ideas and if their based on any of these i will say what. And I’m pretty severely dyslexic so sorry about that.


Basically the virus is actually a really intelligent parasite. Increasing by millions the moment it hits the bloodstream. It will determine through the hosts genes, body, and disorders. The actual worth of the host. A dead person can’t be a host And before turning to a fully turned infected they will gain severe flu like symptoms.

If it doesn’t fit specific standards it is a “weak link” that within a few days will grow severe blisters and boils all over the skin and in the mouth that will burst and bleed large amounts. And will become hyper aggressive attacking anyone they can get their hands on spreading the infection until they die of blood loss or other means. Think world war z but the zombies have weapons and are drenched in their own blood.

If they meet these standards the parasite will improve upon most bodily functions causing whatever injuries they sustained to to heal within hours. And perfectly adapt them to combat nearly any environment. They will mentally degrade but remember everything they learned in their lifetime. Including the use of firearms. They will seek out infected that they knew in their former life and stick together with said infected eventually creating a “pack”. 

Like wolf packs they have an alpha. Most commonly the largest and strongest infected. The alpha controls the pack, it will establish a territory, and seek out food ( packaged, living, and even other undead),and find a shelter for them to inhabit. If two packs see each other there is a chance one will attack, which ever side is victorious the alpha will take the strongest infected from the other and cannibalize the rest. 

They don’t have to worry about food born illnesses because of their improved immune systems via the parasite so they can eat everything raw. Now average intelligence alphas will only use basic tactics to attempt to catch live prey such as ambushing. But higher intelligence alphas will make their own more advanced tactics such as making traps, or even forcing larger groups to break apart and hunting them down one by one. Then will also copy the tactics seen being used by other infected/humans/animals.

But here’s where it really deviates compared to other zombie types. They can still reproduce after they become infected. Meaning they can keep packs populated without the need of finding live humans. Though it is very rare for these children to survive the strain given to the mothers during pregnancy it is possible. And the packs are protective of these children and will raise them until their deemed able to hunt with the group. Then they are treated like any other member 


They are completely devoid of empathy, sympathy, and care for anything outside of the pack but they do show a very primitive form of love to other pack members. 

Infected can be told apart from their uninfected counterparts via their hygiene, hyper activeness, bloody and damaged clothes, and more noticeably their “crazy eyes”.

You can tell how intelligent an alpha is by looking for signs of malnutrition on the infected. And by the number of infected in the pack.

Guns are better than melee weapons and bows,"If I was in the zombie apocalypse, I'd use guns, because firearms are fundamentally better than any bow or knife, or blunt weapon. Hell, even if I lived in a country where guns are scarce, I'd try and fashion one, because guns are better.

How would I escape from New York if....,"I saw a similar question on the page, but it's not as specific as I'm looking for.

Here's the deal. I'm an author under contract to write a post apocalyptic novel where about 98% of New York City is wiped out by a rapidly mutating virus. It takes the city out in under 14 hours. Now I have 3 characters that I need to get out of the city. One is a cop, the other is a receptionist, and the other is a 7 year old kid.

But I CAN NOT figure out how to get them out of the city without walking. And for the pace of the story, walking won't work (plus, a 7 y/o walking though all of that....ugh). So...dead bodies and cars jamming the streets. Bumper to bumper and stalled in most places. Flying is out because none of the characters knows how to fly a plane. I'm angling for a heavy duty military truck or even a well-designed EMS/fire vehicle of some kind that can a) fit on the sidewalks and b) can roll over dead bodies without much trouble. And if that's too unrealistic, maybe it can at least get them to the Hudson and they can get out via water.

Any thoughts? I'm hoping some discussion on this will help me figure this out. For now, I've written myself into a corner it seems.",1,1607544685,soitgoes03,14,1,True,2020-12-09,"how would i escape from new york if.... i saw a similar question on the page, but it's not as specific as i'm looking for.

Does anyone else carry salt in their bugout bag?,"I have a ziploc bag of kosher salt in my bag, but I've never really seen such an item be mentioned in bag setups. It's in my long term survival bag, and doesn't take up too much weight or space.

Dont scroll over!!!,"Heres are my tips when the day comes! You might not know these rules because they're too simple and people didn't pay attention to them.
So,here they are!

Rule 1#
Hair Hell

Don't let your hair grow! Your hair is your greatest enemy. 
Not only it is uneasy to move around, it is also bad for survival! All those walkers can easily snap you out with while escaping from them in a narrow space!

Rule2 #
Windows

Always Check the windows first whenever you are entering! Cars,house and literally anywhere

Rule3 #
No Chainsaw

It is a real bad weapon despite what you have seen on movies. Not only they are heavy, they also consume fuel and make loud sound which will attract more walkers around!

Rule4 #
Bloody wound 

If you had a cut or a wound dont ever make contact a walker near than 5 feets. Think of those cracks entering your body by your opening cuts. If you have no choice but to face walkers find someway to seal it!

Rule5 #
Mosquitoes Repellent

Yes this is the most important thing if you live in tropical, subtropical or even in Dry zone. Who says you can't be infected by a single bite. Also the lotion provides a way to kill skin dryness in winter

Rule6 #
Aim head if not legs

If you are striking a walker aim for head if your weapon cannot gurantee you hit head strike the legs by force will be a temporary solution

Rule7 #
Think of places other people might go and avoid going there!

This is important! Mostly, big groceries,markets and supermarkets even shopping centres will be a choice for many people to loot stuffs and who cant say theres a zombie and bite them off?

Rule8 #
Island! Not a long choice!

Human bodies can be floated and who cant say you would be seeing  a walker reach to your place. Also, think of tsunami,storms and other dangerous stuffs like sea snakes coming up surface!

Rule9 #
Wear buggy clothes a free ticket to heaven!

Dont ever give walkers some chances to grab you easier!
Just wear tight clothings even if you are in a desert. Give it A go for full body wear. Not only they prevent you from walkers grabbing you, they also protect you from UV rays and mosquitoes.

Rule10 #
Stay the fuck alive

Stay the fuck alive as long as you can! Ending of the world doesn't mean you life is end. Dont't be heroic, Don't sprint into the crowd, avoiding is better than facing them!

so,here they are!

rule 1#
hair hell

don't let your hair grow! your hair is your greatest enemy. 
not only it is uneasy to move around, it is also bad for survival! all those walkers can easily snap you out with while escaping from them in a narrow space!

rule2 #
windows

always check the windows first whenever you are entering! cars,house and literally anywhere

rule3 #
no chainsaw

it is a real bad weapon despite what you have seen on movies. not only they are heavy, they also consume fuel and make loud sound which will attract more walkers around!

rule4 #
bloody wound 

if you had a cut or a wound dont ever make contact a walker near than 5 feets. think of those cracks entering your body by your opening cuts. if you have no choice but to face walkers find someway to seal it!

rule5 #
mosquitoes repellent

yes this is the most important thing if you live in tropical, subtropical or even in dry zone. who says you can't be infected by a single bite. also the lotion provides a way to kill skin dryness in winter

rule6 #
aim head if not legs

if you are striking a walker aim for head if your weapon cannot gurantee you hit head strike the legs by force will be a temporary solution

Being born into a post ZA settlement would be a nightmare,"Birth us already a problem because of the lack of medical profesionals. If anything goes wrong the mother and child are screwed.

They would be born into a world with little medical knowledge and probably no medicine. Hygene would also be a problem.

The only brightside is, they would probably be living in an area devoid of zombies. Most probably got destroyed when their parents accupied the area.

Using an axe properly // axe alternative,"I've seen multiple conversations regarding axes on here, and recently watched the mythbusters zombie tests where they tested the usefulness of an axe in this scenario, however even the guys from mythbusters were not swinging the axe correctly.
Swinging an axe incorrectly leads to premature exhastion and potentially hurting yourself, especially if the entire swing is done by gripping the very bottom of the handle.

So on that note, i thought i would find a video that demonstrates how to use an axe correctly (link below)

Obviously if being used against another living person the axe would not be used in this manner at all, but against the dead with no self preservation a proper chop would be a very effective method.
And bonus points being the guy in the video showing how to chop wood properly with an axe by cutting a wedge, bit of extra knowledge if you havent cut wood with an axe before.

https://youtu.be/YIiJYLJDCdI

The only thing he doesn't really explain is that the ""sliding hand"" is also the hand you use to aim your swing.

The downside to an axe as opposed to a straight blunt object is the possibility of getting stuck, this can happen and is a very real potential risk which would make for a good discussion. However they usually are not that hard to remove even from solid wood. With the exception being soft, dense, very wet wood.

For others that are experienced with axes and woodcuting, splitting etc. As well as other tools.
What other tools do you think would be more efficient than an axe?
I wouldnt want to be carrying around a splitter, sledge or full size crowbar, and though i think a claw hammer or something is a decent option the lack of reach would lead me to grab an axe over a claw hammer, tyre iron, small crowbars etc.

Bonus points if your idea is both efficient for a weapon in a SHTF scenario  and has practical applications either around the home or camping/hunting/fishing (if im going to buy something, id like it to be useful and not just sit in the shed in the event the SHTF)

Potato power,"This is my most stupid one so far.

Could we use potatoes as An alternate or more realisticaly a temporary power source.

After a few quick Google searches i figured out that a potato produces 0.2 amps. We can boil them to increase that ten fold. And we can use multiple to increase the amount of power they produce even more

So if other power sources are Unavailable and we have a potato farm, could we produce enough  power from them to perhaps recharge a  Aa battery.

Im asking the question if we can do that and how would we do it.

I got this idea, because I needed ideas for a science project and from Google search see the clasic project of creating a potato battery.

Zombie virus scenario #3: cause of zombie virus: mad cow disease: location: farm in Great Britain.,"In the 1990's mad cow disease almost destroyed the fast food industry. Thankfully due to new feeding systems for cows and terminating infected cows. McDonalds still exists. But this time.

The cows are not the victims. Humans are. 

A new strain of MCD infects a cow. This virus is unique. It can infect people as well as poor cows. This cow now infected comes across its farmer. He charges him and with a crunch. Bites him. He is now infected. He rushes himself to a hospital but it is too late. He becomes infected and hungry just as he is being taken into theatre. He bites the 2 surgeons taking him and they become infected. Seeing the incident take place. The people in the waiting room flee to the exits and hit a fire alarm. Security is called but unfortunately they do not have an armory. Just tazers which they know won't do anything against the zombies. They try and flee but the 3 security guards sent in are bitten. There are now 6 zombies. And they are very hungry. Fortunately. Due to the fire alarm being set of everyone escapes with their skin. 2 minutes later so do the zombies. One person who got to close to the exit where the undead left from is bitten. There are now 7 undead. The police is contacted and they immediately know what to do. They order an evacuation of the town. All of the 250 people in the town escape. Unfortunately 20 never will. They are now part of the 27 zombies. The police immediately open fire on the heads of the undead  emptying magazine after magazine of ammo. The zombies are killed. The hospital undergoes decontamination by a 30 person hazmat unit and over 4 days the infected cows are terminated, the other cows are moved to a new farm and the 250 people living in the town are tested. No new infection is found. And the people can now go back to living their lives.

Zombie scenario #4: cause of zombie virus: Chronic wasting disease: location: forest in The United States of America,"Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) or ""Zombie deer disease"" infects the brain cells of deer.

An evolutionary glitch takes place and the disease can now infect humans. This new strain first infects a deer who becomes VERY aggressive.

They exit the hospital. But not the kill and eat. These zombies are different. Like i said. These zombies need water. Of any quality is acceptable. They are found plby the police who were contacted and they start shooting. The zombies are shown no mercy and are ripped apart by the police's shotguns and sub machine guns. No zombie survivors. A hazmat team takes a sample of the disease to study a d research while anyone in the hospital is tested. The hospital is then de-contaminated over 2 days.

Things to do today to succeed in an emergency tomorrow,"I've always liked to use zombies as a fun metaphor for any emergency situation where one might likely have constrained resources and/or deal with hostile parties. To that end it's nice to think about tactics and tricks that might make your life easier in such a stressful situation. With anything, I find the easiest steps to implement are the small ones we can do with ease. 


Here's a few things I've picked up over the years. Feel free to add yours below. 

Planning on carrying gear in a bag or other load bearing equipment? Put it on and wear it around the house. Go for a long hike in it if possible. If you're going to move long ranges with a lot of weight on your back, your body needs to acclimate to it. Beyond that, you want to make sure you have mobility and comfort and moving in your gear can let you know what items need to be modified to set you up for success (when I initially did this I realized some of my LBE gear was too loose and caused chaffing on long range hikes). Something as simple as practicing movement around your house in your gear can help you refine your set up and acclimate to wearing it though. 

Do pushups, squats and situps a few times a week. I like to do them before dinner every other day. Running/cardio should also be implemented often too. You want to build strength and cardio to be more ready for an emergency. Start small today, and build yourself up. 

Start eating healthier and make a weightloss plan if you need to. Speaking from personal experience, having to hump heavy gear long range sucks even more if your body is also contended with a lot of excess body fat too. Your knees and feet will thank you later, I promise. 

Using a melee weapon? Take it outside and practice swinging for prolonged sessions. People don't think about how tiring swinging a melee weapon around is. While they don't run out of ammo, your body can and will run out of energy. Acclimate yourself to the activity. Also, you want the attacking motions to be muscle memory (find instruction on how to use your weapon and drill yourself on those moves). You don't want the time you have to defend your life to be the first time you've ever used it. Same goes for guns really.

Buy medical supplies and learn how to use them. Staying alive is more important than killing the other guy in a fight. Invest in some quality tourniquets and other trauma gear. You can buy IFAKs online for pretty cheap, and there's a lot of instructional videos for how to use that gear. Formal instruction is even better if you can swing it. 

Have battery operated gear? Get into the habbit of changing those batteries on a schedule. My red dot sights have a battery life of 3-5 years, but I like to change them around my birthday every year just to be safe.

Canned goods and water storage are always a nice thing to have. Worst case scenario you can always break into your stock pile later. We stocked up on canned goods, and invested in supplies to can and store food long term. We also invested in water storage and supplies to purify water if the grip goes down. A months supplies isn't that hard to accumulate, but I like to have way more if possible. Again, of the world doesn't end you can always break into your stash later. This goes for pet food/supplies as well. 

Those are a few things I picked up from people smarter than myself. Feel free to add some lessons of your own below.",1,1604212501,OlDBY37,7,1,True,2020-11-01,"things to do today to succeed in an emergency tomorrow i've always liked to use zombies as a fun metaphor for any emergency situation where one might likely have constrained resources and/or deal with hostile parties. to that end it's nice to think about tactics and tricks that might make your life easier in such a stressful situation. with anything, i find the easiest steps to implement are the small ones we can do with ease. 


here's a few things i've picked up over the years. feel free to add yours below. 

planning on carrying gear in a bag or other load bearing equipment? put it on and wear it around the house. go for a long hike in it if possible. if you're going to move long ranges with a lot of weight on your back, your body needs to acclimate to it. beyond that, you want to make sure you have mobility and comfort and moving in your gear can let you know what items need to be modified to set you up for success (when i initially did this i realized some of my lbe gear was too loose and caused chaffing on long range hikes). something as simple as practicing movement around your house in your gear can help you refine your set up and acclimate to wearing it though. 

do pushups, squats and situps a few times a week. i like to do them before dinner every other day. running/cardio should also be implemented often too. you want to build strength and cardio to be more ready for an emergency. start small today, and build yourself up. 

start eating healthier and make a weightloss plan if you need to. speaking from personal experience, having to hump heavy gear long range sucks even more if your body is also contended with a lot of excess body fat too. your knees and feet will thank you later, i promise. 

using a melee weapon? take it outside and practice swinging for prolonged sessions. people don't think about how tiring swinging a melee weapon around is. while they don't run out of ammo, your body can and will run out of energy. acclimate yourself to the activity. also, you want the attacking motions to be muscle memory (find instruction on how to use your weapon and drill yourself on those moves). you don't want the time you have to defend your life to be the first time you've ever used it. same goes for guns really.

buy medical supplies and learn how to use them. staying alive is more important than killing the other guy in a fight. invest in some quality tourniquets and other trauma gear. you can buy ifaks online for pretty cheap, and there's a lot of instructional videos for how to use that gear. formal instruction is even better if you can swing it. 

have battery operated gear? get into the habbit of changing those batteries on a schedule. my red dot sights have a battery life of 3-5 years, but i like to change them around my birthday every year just to be safe.

canned goods and water storage are always a nice thing to have. worst case scenario you can always break into your stock pile later. we stocked up on canned goods, and invested in supplies to can and store food long term. we also invested in water storage and supplies to purify water if the grip goes down. a months supplies isn't that hard to accumulate, but i like to have way more if possible. again, of the world doesn't end you can always break into your stash later. this goes for pet food/supplies as well.

My strat for surviving zombie apoc (sorry if i used the wrong flair),"1. I would first make a makeshift spear from a broom and a knife, i would go outside and baricade the metal gate with a picnic table in the communal yard (its a yard for multiple people). Also i live in a tighty packed but small coastal city. I would tell my friends to study zombie survival while internet is still up and even better, put it on a flash drive. I would also tell them to keep in touch for as long as possible via something like viber. I would also tell them to baricade the door. I would wait about 72 hours or more, for things to calm down and people to die.  While waiting i stay in touch with friends. Sadly we all still live with our parents. But if any of my friends get separated from his or her family, i would recomend they beeline to my home. Why my home? Because there are 4 doors separating me from the outside world and there are stairs we can destroy. Also i would tell my grandparents to stay put and we will bring food and water. 

2. The chaos has ended, zombies rome the streets. Power is likely to go out soon so now i would start the search for walkietalkies. Me and my dad (and any other willing friend or friends dad) will go to the neighbouring city, which has a shopping center, we would go find a few walkie talkies, some extra batteries and other things and deliver them to my friends. We would also stop for food, because we likely ate quite a lot, we would also bring some bottled water if water goes out sooner then expected. During this time, we would likely be spending most time home, the rest we would spend getting foodvand water. We will becalso likely be searching for a source of electricity (dont know much on this, so can someone pls tell me how could we get electricity. If the house gets over run. I would use a pull up ladder or a rope ladder to go to out the window (1st story). We can go a few places: one of the 3 schools, one is a highschool with dorms and a cafeteria on ground level. Then thete is ab apartment complex near an elementary school that is hard to describe, but its an abosulte fortress. Then there is an old peoples home in the city center. But if there is literally no whare to go, we can go to an abandoned home or house in the nearby hills (which are quite densely populated). We would most likely accept any survivors, but we woudnt go past 8 people.

Pro Tip: Download and print out a bunch of guides,"The US military has a lot of extremely useful guides for things that would be incredibly useful in a zombie apocalypse (any apocalypse, really).

In printing these out or buying them online, you’ll be able to deal with nearly any situation that comes your way. You can also print multiples out for trade, because guides will become valuable commodities. If you want to ignore my recommendations, make sure to pick up some guides on tool-making, subsistence farming, survival skills, and first aid.

***

My recommendations:

* 1970s version of the US Army Survival Manual 21-76

This has general survival skills. I specified the 1970s version because it has lessons on evasion and escape.

* Army Ranger Handbook

Rangers lead the way.

* Visual Signals FM 21-60

This’ll help with communication, it has everything from hand gestures to smoke signals.

* FM 34-81-1 (1992) Battlefield Weather Effects

This will teach you how to deal with inclement weather. From rain to snow to extreme sun, you’ll be prepared.

&gt; NIGHT COMBAT: Historical Study. Department of the Army Pamphlet No. 20-236

May be skippable because you shouldn’t be going out at night anyway, but download it just to be sure.

&gt; TC 31-29 Special Forces Caching Techniques [(Free Download)](https://www.survivalsullivan.com/pdf/free/TC-31-29-Special-Forces-Caching-Technique.pdf)

This’ll teach you how to set up caches around your area, so you’re never out of range of food, water, and ammo.

&gt; CIVIL DISTURBANCE OPERATIONS, FM 3-19.15

This’ll teach you how to deal with hostile humans, who will probably be deadlier that the zombies.

&gt; 100 Deadly Skills: The SEAL Operative's Guide to Eluding Pursuers, Evading Capture, and Surviving Any Dangerous Situation

SERE techniques are valuable, but this will really only apply to human adversaries. 

&gt; Army Improvised Munitions Handbook

Molotovs, pipe bombs, and pipe guns? Yes, indeed. This book will teach you how to improvise the best weapons around.

&gt; Modern Day Gunslinger: The Ultimate Handgun Training Manual

This will become less useful as the apocalypse rages on, and won’t help at all unless you have a handgun or will be able to find one. It’s safe to skip this one if you don’t live in the US (or Switzerland). 

&gt; First Aid for Soldiers U.S. Army

First aid is a much needed skill in the apocalypse, especially since doctors will be hard to come by. Not only will this book help you get skills that make you an enticing member for any large group, but it’ll help you help yourself solo.

&gt; Field Manual FM 4-25.11 (FM 21-11) First Aid including Change 1 issued July 2004 also NTRP 4-02.1.1 AFMAN 44-163(I), MCRP 3-02G

With a doozy of a title, this is basically more first aid and battlefield medicine. Don’t be like Doc, a medic is supposed to save lives not make them more comfortable as they die.

&gt; Design Forms for a Concrete Wall [(Free Download)](https://www.survivalsullivan.com/pdf/free/US-ARMY-Design-Forms-For-A-Concrete-Wall-En5151.pdf) 

This’ll teach you how to make a proper wall. Build the wall and make the zombies pay for it.

&gt; The Complete Illustrated Guide to Farming

This is huge (size-wise), and will help you start up a farm. Becoming food independent is the end goal to any apocalypse scenario, but make sure that your walls are strong.

&gt; Back to Basics: A Complete Guide to Traditional Skills, Third Edition

This has tons of assorted skills, from jam making to log cabin building.

&gt; The Ultimate Survival Manual

This is what it says on the tin, it has skills “such as how to survive a wildfire, how to successfully jump from a moving train, swimming through burning oil, how to predict the weather from plants, or how to cross a fast-moving river.” There’s also illustrations and diagrams.

&gt; SAS Survival Handbook

The Brits wanted in on the fun, so here they come. More basic survival skills.

&gt; When Technology Fails

It’s a book that goes into detail about what you can expect when an apocalypse hits, and can help with solutions.",1,1604826488,CMDR_Kai,4,1,True,2020-11-08,"pro tip: download and print out a bunch of guides the us military has a lot of extremely useful guides for things that would be incredibly useful in a zombie apocalypse (any apocalypse, really).

in printing these out or buying them online, you’ll be able to deal with nearly any situation that comes your way. you can also print multiples out for trade, because guides will become valuable commodities. if you want to ignore my recommendations, make sure to pick up some guides on tool-making, subsistence farming, survival skills, and first aid.

***

my recommendations:

* 1970s version of the us army survival manual 21-76

this has general survival skills. i specified the 1970s version because it has lessons on evasion and escape.

* army ranger handbook

rangers lead the way.

* visual signals fm 21-60

this’ll help with communication, it has everything from hand gestures to smoke signals.

* fm 34-81-1 (1992) battlefield weather effects

this will teach you how to deal with inclement weather. from rain to snow to extreme sun, you’ll be prepared.

&gt; night combat: historical study. department of the army pamphlet no. 20-236

may be skippable because you shouldn’t be going out at night anyway, but download it just to be sure.

&gt; tc 31-29 special forces caching techniques [(free download)](https://www.survivalsullivan.com/pdf/free/tc-31-29-special-forces-caching-technique.pdf)

this’ll teach you how to set up caches around your area, so you’re never out of range of food, water, and ammo.

&gt; civil disturbance operations, fm 3-19.15

this’ll teach you how to deal with hostile humans, who will probably be deadlier that the zombies.

&gt; 100 deadly skills: the seal operative's guide to eluding pursuers, evading capture, and surviving any dangerous situation

sere techniques are valuable, but this will really only apply to human adversaries. 

&gt; army improvised munitions handbook

molotovs, pipe bombs, and pipe guns? yes, indeed. this book will teach you how to improvise the best weapons around.

&gt; modern day gunslinger: the ultimate handgun training manual

this will become less useful as the apocalypse rages on, and won’t help at all unless you have a handgun or will be able to find one. it’s safe to skip this one if you don’t live in the us (or switzerland). 

&gt; first aid for soldiers u.s. army

first aid is a much needed skill in the apocalypse, especially since doctors will be hard to come by. not only will this book help you get skills that make you an enticing member for any large group, but it’ll help you help yourself solo.

&gt; field manual fm 4-25.11 (fm 21-11) first aid including change 1 issued july 2004 also ntrp 4-02.1.1 afman 44-163(i), mcrp 3-02g

with a doozy of a title, this is basically more first aid and battlefield medicine. don’t be like doc, a medic is supposed to save lives not make them more comfortable as they die.

&gt; design forms for a concrete wall [(free download)](https://www.survivalsullivan.com/pdf/free/us-army-design-forms-for-a-concrete-wall-en5151.pdf) 

this’ll teach you how to make a proper wall. build the wall and make the zombies pay for it.

&gt; the complete illustrated guide to farming

this is huge (size-wise), and will help you start up a farm. becoming food independent is the end goal to any apocalypse scenario, but make sure that your walls are strong.

&gt; back to basics: a complete guide to traditional skills, third edition

this has tons of assorted skills, from jam making to log cabin building.

&gt; the ultimate survival manual

this is what it says on the tin, it has skills “such as how to survive a wildfire, how to successfully jump from a moving train, swimming through burning oil, how to predict the weather from plants, or how to cross a fast-moving river.” there’s also illustrations and diagrams.

&gt; sas survival handbook

the brits wanted in on the fun, so here they come. more basic survival skills.

&gt; when technology fails

it’s a book that goes into detail about what you can expect when an apocalypse hits, and can help with solutions."
"Pro Tip: Develop marketable skills now, so you’ll be able to use them later","Marketable skills are basically anything that may come up as useful during a zombie apocalypse. From being able to make clothes to knowing advanced first aid, anything that makes you a valuable member of a group will drastically increase your odds of survival. 

For example, a large group may have to exile members if supplies get too low, if you’re just some schmoe with little skill then you’re getting dropped but if you can patch members of the away team up then you’ll be a keeper.

***

My recommendations:

* Clothing repair and construction 

This includes skills like sewing and crochet. Someone who can make and repair clothes is valuable because clothes will quickly become damages, and it’s not like you can just pop down to Target and grab some new Kevlar gloves. A tailor can also become a doctor in a pinch by sewing up wounds.

* First aid

This is obvious. Learn CPR, how to operate an AED, how to make basic remedies, etc. Keep people alive, and they’ll do the same for you. Just make sure to have a good bedside manner.

* Piloting/boat captaining

A bit of a niche, but if you’re able to unlock sections of land that would otherwise be inaccessible then you’ll be set for a good long while.

* Hunting and tracking

This is obvious, a single deer can feed a large group for a few nights but it won’t be feeding anyone unless someone can kill it, skin it, gut it, and cook it. Hopefully that someone is you.

* Subsistence farming

This is also obvious, plants are great sources of nutrients but they aren’t doing anyone any good if they’re stuck as seeds.

* Cooking and food preparation 

In learning cooking, you’ll become a favorite in a group because people won’t be dying of food poisoning and hopefully you’ll be able to make the food taste halfway decent. Morale boosts are powerful things, and good eatings is one of the best.

Food preparation deals with keeping food edible in the long term. Making jerky and properly salting food are two examples.

* Construction 

Nobody wants to survive long-term in a lean-to or car, if you can build adobe huts or log cabins then you’ll be a valuable member of any group.

* Mechanics

If you can get machines working, then you’ll live longer because you’ll act as a force multiplier for any group. This can be anything from repairing vehicles, to maintaining guns, to *making* guns.",1,1604827459,CMDR_Kai,9,1,True,2020-11-08,"pro tip: develop marketable skills now, so you’ll be able to use them later marketable skills are basically anything that may come up as useful during a zombie apocalypse. from being able to make clothes to knowing advanced first aid, anything that makes you a valuable member of a group will drastically increase your odds of survival.

Hello guys!

Use your skills to craft tools, start a farm, and head out into the world to scavenge supplies while saving lives. Zombies will come for you eventually — so prepare yourself and your home by readying your defenses and making sure your weapons are locked and loaded. After all — a zombie apocalypse is tough to overcome, even if it’s in a pixelated universe. But don’t lose hope — keep crafting and carry on!

Following successful crowdfunding campaigns, Zelter has amassed thousands of fans and is now ready to open up the game to Steam’s Early Access. During the Early Access period, the developers will continue to gather feedback from players and create community-driven content to expand and improve the Zelter experience!

* Turn Your Home Into a Fortress: Everyone needs a safe place to rest their heads after a tough day of blasting reanimated corpses back into the afterlife. In Zelter, players collect resources and craft items to build the ultimate zombie-proof homestead!
* Build Your Dream Team: Rescue survivors and work together to hunt down valuable supplies and man the battlements — plus, it’s always good to have extra bait to distract the undead

My perfect zombie survival guide,"(Note im talking about walking dead style zombies the key features being they function off smell and partially off sight and are slow moving)

1. grab any food/tools or electronics and useful friends or family members have your squad already picked out with a max of 8 people

2. Go to a location outside of town a farmhouse is a good idea

3. If you're stuck at home deploy number 4 

4. Start making spike traps and anything zombies can impale themselves on this will hopefully drive away other zombies also cover windows if you can't cover a window in a room board the room off make sure they can't see you

4.5. Hang up Irish spring or other strong scented soap to also drive away other zombies 

5. Raid unusual locations i recommended bars they usually have a freezer with food and alcohol in it it may not be great but its useful also be sure to send your runners out with things like baseball bats and crowbars be sure to get the pool balls and pool ques if possible they make for great weapons and parts for other weapons 

6. Make basic armor out of towels and duct tape be sure to cover easy to bite areas in order to make armor wrap towels around the location until thick then apply tape it can be further enhanced by other items such as wood foam or metal

7 start growing plants and working on vehicles or weapons and armor if possible

Old vs. New,"Hello all, this is a question I’ve been pondering for some time and I’m curious what everyone else thinks.

When it comes to vehicles I can never decide if I would want to stick with old or new. This might sound like a dumb question at first but hear me out.
I drive a 90’s Suburban, my wife drives a 2017 Acadia. I know GMC/Chevy pretty damn well up to about 97. I’m very mechanically inclined and most vehicle issues aren’t a problem for me; however, in a zombie wasteland how realistic would it be to expect to be able to diagnose newer vehicles with all the electrical systems in place? And even if you succeed in diagnosis, how many parts are readily available? Older vehicles often share the same parts and are interchangeable with other models of the same make. In newer vehicles I haven’t found this to be the case. I often wonder if it would be more practical for someone to try and maintain an older vehicle with more simple electrical systems, fewer sensors to fail, less moving parts, etc. Beyond that, I feel emergency, bandaid-solutions are a lot easier on older vehicles.

"Post Apocalyptic Agriculture: Crops, Meat, Dairy, Soil, and Gas.","In this Redditor's opinion, the best crops for early post-apocalyptic agriculture, by a wide margin are Potatoes and Corn.

Potatoes because they're quick growing, don't require especially rich soil to thrive, and can be survived off of almost entirely.

 This is not only a major plot point in the popular book and movie ""the martian"" but also backed by a years long study, called ""Ireland""

Corn because of its quick growing and high versatility. Being useful as a flour, a sugar, and being used to make acohol, which is useful as a fuel, Disinfectant, and inebriant. 

Now, the worst crops for early post-apocalyptic agriculture are grains and leafy greens. They don't provide enough per plant produced to be worthwhile early on.

Depending on where you set up shop, you'll want some combination of greenhouses and light diffusers. Greenhouses can be made out of a number of materials, from glass to plastic. And light diffusers can be made easily out of thin fabric. 

Now, onto meat.

Some general rules of thumb for livestock in the during times is, the more space it takes to thrive the worse it is, it should be easy to find, and should reproduce quickly and numerously.

For this reason, rabbits and pigs are some of the best for early livestock animals. Both are rather abundant, reproduce quickly and in large quantities, and eat very common materials. Both can survive off of the scraps of your crops. 

Animal fat is useful in production of soap, and animal waste is useful for reasons I will explain later.

Some animals to stay away from in the meat department are Cows, sheep and goats As they require large amounts of space and pasture. This advice also applies to dairy with one notable exception.

Dairy: 

The best animal for post post-apocalyptic dairy is the goat. While not the most efficient for meat, they're by far the best for dairy (not like there's much competition). They don't require pasture and they can survive off of crop scraps. They're milk can also be used interchangeably with cows milk for baking. 

Soil: 

If the dirt in your area leaves something to be desired, you can always make your own. All you need is animal waste, plant scraps, and mulched carcass (presumably that of zombies) as well as human waste or ""nightsoil"" 

You mix them with water in a large container or many smaller containers and wait for them to decompose. Once properly decomposed, move to an open container and leave to dry.

 This setup also allows for our next topic.

Gas: 

Methane to be precise. Take our soil producing setup and attach a gas inlet onto it, feed the inlet through a bubbler(a tube that opens in a container of water with another inlet above the water) and feed the gas somewhere for storage. 

You can use existing gas storage devices such as propane tanks to store the methane, or you could use a gasometer, which stores the gas at atmospheric pressure using water and the buoyancy of the gas to raise the tank's interior tank in a pool of water. 

Methane can be used as fuel for fires, which makes it incredibly versatile if you can produce it in vast quantities.

"Desert Settlement: where to set up, why set up there, and how to set up.","The biggest upside and downside of settling in a desert are the same thing. They're hard to survive in. Zombies can't find you before they die from the heat, but you need to take extra steps to ensure you don't suffer the same fate. Here's the steps you'll want to take.

Location: 

You'll want to set up about a 8-10 hour walk away from a large population. Somewhere near a road where you could easily get a car on and off of the sand. You'll want to avoid setting up directly inside of a gas station, as that would prevent other survivors from utilising it for temporary shelter. Always remember to be considerate of other humans' needs. 


Getting there:

 you'll want to use a vehicle with high fuel efficiency 
and hauling capacity. A semi or city bus would be some of the better options, but a pick up or mail truck will also work. Make sure you have extra fuel, water and food on board. At least 1 weeks surplus.


Materials: 

To establish your base, you'll need some materials. 

Solar panels, wires, glass and/or plastic, thin white fabric, structural materials, shovel, hammer, thick black, fabric, containers, an air-conditioning unit, pipes/and ducting materials. It should be noted that you can make multiple trips, as many of these materials are for later on.


Laying foundation: 

Start out by pitching a tent with some of the structural material, using some thick black fabric as the outermost layer some thin white fabric as the innermost layer. This helps to keep the inside cool. 

Build some solar water reclaimers, take a sheet of glass or plastic and place it over a hole in which you will dump dirty water and urine into. If you're using flexible plastic, create a depression in the center and suspend a container to catch the water in the middle. If you're using glass, set the glass at an angle so the water drips down into a container placed at the lowest end.

Once you've set up a tent and reliable water, you'll want to start digging a large gully about 3-5 feet deep, and tent over it with the fabrics in much the same fashion as your initial tent. The extra depth will help to keep the base cooler. 

Then, lay out as many solar panels as you could get your hands on and wire them together. Place the cool side of the air conditioner into the duncting material, with the heat exhaust facing towards the outside, remember to shade the unit. You can then duct the cool air throughout your base as you expand it.

And expansion is rather easy with trench tents. Just dig out the trench, tent over, and duct the AC into it.



Self-sufficiency:

Your food surplus will only last so long. And you can't keep making trips into the city and hunting forever. You need agriculture.

You'll need soil, plastic, thin white fabric, containers and structural materials.

Make tent similar to the ones before it, but instead have the thin white fabric on the outside and plastic on the inside. This will let it get bright without getting (quite literally) boiling hot.

Next, fill the containers with soil. If you can't find soil, then you can make it by mulching carcasses and plants together and waiting for them to decompose. 

You'll need to decide on what plants to grow, I suggest potatoes and corn due to their versatility, high nutritional value, and ease of growth. But it's up to you.

Once you have reliable greenhouses established, you'll want livestock. Pigs are best for this purpose as they're highly omnivorous and can survive off of basically anything. A pig pen tent should be a gully separate from your base's trench structure, tented over, with a fan to circulate the air, and some kind of internal trench to remove manure from the pen and into a container.

Pigs don't fare well in sunlight, so you'll want to keep them in the shade at all times.

Common post-apocalyptic survival tips that will get you killed,"1. Don't drink your pee, even if it's sterile it has ammonia in it, which is toxic.

2. Don't let bread get moldy to improvise ""antibiotics"" this won't work. Trust me.

Zombie Survival Unpopular Opinion - Don't Head Into The Woods,"After 2 days of camping with the wife, I realized how properly f'ed most of society would be in an apocalyptic scenario.

How effective are flamethrowers in a zombie apocalypse,"I came up with 3 DIY flamethrowers:

Design 1: i use a can of deoderant or such as long as its flamable, i attach a lighter close too the deoderant nozle (like a few centimeters) i attach some sort of string to the lighter button and make a loop at the end i add a notch bellow the lighter so it holds down the button. When i would use it i would pull the string down and attaching it to the notch and then fire up the lighter. The flamethrower is now ready, when i want to fire i spray the deoderant. This is the handhand flamethrower.

Pros: portable and lightweight

Cons- your hand is close to the lighter

Design 2: same thing, but i use a deoderant or flamable spray with longer range and add a small tube between the lightet and spray

Pros: your hand is safer and (my hypothesis) should have a more controlled spray of flames

Cons: limited range because of the distance between the can and the lighter

Design 3: the first one but with a flamable spray in a window cleaner spray. I call this one the buret flamethrower. 

Pros: safer, controlled spray

Cons: less powerfull and non continous blast

All of the designs have the con of not being able to refill easily. The lighter must be replaced along with the cans, design 3 can have the spray be refilled easily by just opening it and puring a full one into it (if my memory is not lying they can be opened right?)

Zombie Weapon Analysis: Atlatl,"Overview: I have heard quite a few people talk about how they would use an atlatl as their main weapon in a zombie apocalypse, so I thought I would make a post analyzing this choice.

The Weapon: The atlatl, or spear thrower, is a small (about two foot) device used all over the world, but prominently by mesoamerican, arctic, and aboriginal tribes. It throws a thin spear (\~5ft) up to 150 yards effectively.

Pros:

\-Ranged. While it is not the best ranged weapon out there, it is ranged, which can be pretty valuable.

\-Easy to make. Anyone with a picture to go off of, a piece of wood, and a knife or two can make one with enough time. They are easy to make and easy to operate.

\-Robust. The spears that are thrown can take a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and quality. While you will get the best results with a certain length and weight, the atlatl can operate with quite a lot of variation.

\-Ammo. Related to the last two points, the ammo would be fairly easy to make. A long stick sharpened down, while not ideal, could work quite well.

Cons:

\-Slow. The atlatl is pretty slow to use, especially compared to other ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows, and guns.

\-Short range. Compared to bows, crossbows, and guns, the atlatl has a pretty short range.

\-Poor accuracy. Take this one with a grain of salt, as I have never used an atlatl for more than twenty minutes, but it seems harder to aim consistently with than just throwing or than bow/crossbow/gun.

Summary:

The atlatl is not a great weapon for a zombie apocalypse. Everything it can do, a bow/crossbow/gun can do better. It can definitely be used in certain circumstances, but I would never pick this weapon over other reasonable weapons. Something that occurred to me that you can use it for is hunting. While, once again, a bow, crossbow, or gun, is more accurate, powerful, and has a longer range, carbon fiber arrows and bullets are going to be in really high demand, meaning this is somewhere the atlatl shines. Because of how easy it is to get ammo for, it could realistically be used for hunting in order to save bullets and nice arrows for more important tasks (like killing zombies or other people).

 In terms of short term viability, on a scale from one to ten, I would rank it a two. It is ranged, which is good, but it does not have much else going for it. In terms of long term viability, on the same scale, I would give it a four or five. It can definitely be useful long term, and can definitely help you survive easier, but it is not necessary and you could easily go without.

"Horses, Why?","I have heard that horses are a good option when looking for a ride for the zombie apocalypse, but their not good at all.

Sure, there good gas savers (since they don't run on gas) but that's the only good part. There loud, bad at getting away, and weak. I am going to use a 1988 Toyota Hilux as an example car.

There loud as hell. First of the hooves, the hooves are pretty loud. They might only be when it is walking, but it is much louder. They also neigh, which the car doesn't.

Second of all, they are super hard to get away with. They are very tall, and even trained horse riders need something to get up on the horse. They also can't go very fast compared to the car, and you most likely you would need to start slowly when getting on the horse. There backs are an average of 4.7 feet tall (floor to back) and you need quite a little bit of arm strength to lift your self on the horse. Also, there average top speed is 50 mph, and gets there in about 10 minutes (guess). Compared to the car which isn't as tall, has a top speed of 105 and can get to 60 in 10.2 seconds. 

Lastly, they are weak. The Toyota has been driven down stairs, side swiped buildings, and crashed into a tree. It also has been drowned, and lost as sea. After using a simple tool kit and mechanic, it was able to fix it. They drove it through a shed, the dropped a small trailer on it, and even hit with a wrecking ball.

Realistic zombie virus,"I think the realistic zombie virus would likely be like this:

1. It doesn't make the infected to become stronger or faster than the uninfected (normal people). The virus is just going to make them lose their minds, so they are just fearless.
2. The infected are not dead. They are alive, but there is nothing human left to them. 
3. The infection is either through cells or bloodline. If it's by the cells then the infection could be stopped by cutting the non-vital body parts. If it's by the bloodline then the cutting needs to be done immediately after the bite/scratch infection.

My question is:

If the infection spreads through the bloodline how long does it take for the virus to reach the brain and what is the maximum time to cut the infected body part to stop the infection?",1,1599813738,shouldicallumista,35,1,True,2020-09-11,"realistic zombie virus i think the realistic zombie virus would likely be like this:

CoVid19 turns into Zombie Virus 2020,"Okay... So we waited way to long to consider CoVid19 a pandemic. The virus continues to mutate, and eventually turns into a new strand that affects the protein buildup in your DNA (turning the sick into zombies but only transmitted to others through bite, scratch or direct bodily fluid contact with the infected).

Your one outfit of choice.

Ideas regarding a variety of melee weapons.,"Melee weapons in general would be an essential part of survival in the zombie apocalypse. While many of us have useful ranged weapons like firearms and bows, I feel that most here would probably be reliant on hand to hand weapons initially. There are endless possibilities. I would like to discuss and know your thoughts on some specific weapons as well as certain categories of melee weapons.  
  
  
First category: Axes/hatchets  

I feel that axes to many are a sort of ""default"" weapon that people would immediately go to as a defensive tool. There are a large variety. Here are some examples that I have.  
- Small versions like the [Hatchet](https://i.imgur.com/SCKNcbX.jpg) and [Tomahawk](https://i.imgur.com/IGis6SG.jpg).  
- Medium sizes like the [small forest axe](https://i.imgur.com/SPFU82a.jpg)  
- Large axes like the [bearded fighting axe](https://i.imgur.com/kUdhMn0.jpg) and [wood chopping](https://i.imgur.com/bePAeTH.jpg) axes.  
I feel that axes in general are excellent tools and most would do very nicely as impromptu weapons.  
  
Second category: Machetes   
Machetes are probably the most common gardening tool on earth. They're a very useful tool in many circumstances. Like axes, machetes come in a huge variety.  
- Traditional machetes like the [latin style](https://i.imgur.com/FdiOmMZ.jpg) and the [panga](https://i.imgur.com/7jWQaZ6.jpg).  
- Sword-like machetes like the [cutlass](https://i.imgur.com/r8Gb9K6.jpg) and the [kukri](https://i.imgur.com/2MR5uqS.jpg).  
- Smaller machetes like this [Bowie styled](https://i.imgur.com/qKGjRLb.jpg) one.  
Overall, I think any long blade has the potential to make a decent weapon as long as the steel is of decent quality. In general, I think machetes would be among the most effective weapons in a zombie apocalypse. I do think that [actual swords](https://i.imgur.com/NsPliPv.jpg) would be more effective as weapons but their inability to function as tools hinders their usefulness. 
  
Third category: Blunt Instruments  
Blunt objects are incredibly common. You'll find them in basically any home on earth. Many everyday items can be used as weapons such as hammers and bats. Here are a few categories of purpose made impact weapons.  
- Most hammers are just tools, however there are dedicated versions like [war hammers](https://i.imgur.com/2cK1sCz.jpg).  
- Clubs are a very diverse category and come in many forms. [Knobbed](https://i.imgur.com/8tNJppm.jpg) and [Spiked](https://i.imgur.com/w0eFN2l.jpg) clubs are fairly simple. [Maces](https://i.imgur.com/83LSnot.jpg) are generally more complex.  
- A popular weapon in fantasy is the [Flail](https://i.imgur.com/Fh4DM2i.jpg). A simple weight attached to a handle with a chain. Flails are definitely overused in those genres and are certainly not as effective as most would think.  
I feel that clubs and other blunt weapons would make up the largest range of possibilities when looking a melee weapons. Most are not purpose made, however. Tools like hammers, crowbars, and tire irons come to mind for many people imagining what they'd use in the apocalypse. I feel that these would make up the majority of weapons you'd see in areas of the world with low firearm availability.  
  
Fourth category: Knives  
Knives are an essential tool for most everyone even before any apocalypse. They come in huge varieties and styles.  
- general outdoors style varying between [modern and traditional](https://i.imgur.com/WuH6pxW.jpg).  
- Large blades like the [bowie and bushcraft](https://i.imgur.com/G9cppub.jpg) styles as well as [kukris](https://i.imgur.com/VBITw7c.jpg)  
- Bayonets which can vary between [normal knives](https://i.imgur.com/TN01KEA.jpg) and [long spikes](https://i.imgur.com/ZPDXlTa.jpg)  
- Dedicated [fighting knives](https://i.imgur.com/uWomkPX.jpg)  
- cheaply made [""mall ninja""](https://i.imgur.com/gnGZBy1.jpg) knives  
 Many are useful tools while some are incredibly dangerous to the user due to poor quality. I think knives can make excellent weapons against normal opponents but zombies require a vastly different method of attack. I feel that knives, with some exceptions, would not be good weapons specifically in a zombie apocalypse. The incredibly short range combined with the effort needed to puncture a skull properly mean that, while better than nothing, a knife is a poor choice. I think you should always carry one, however, as there are still infinite uses for them besides being weapons.",1,1599981568,throwayay123654,59,26,True,2020-09-13,"ideas regarding a variety of melee weapons. melee weapons in general would be an essential part of survival in the zombie apocalypse. while many of us have useful ranged weapons like firearms and bows, i feel that most here would probably be reliant on hand to hand weapons initially. there are endless possibilities. i would like to discuss and know your thoughts on some specific weapons as well as certain categories of melee weapons.

Utility of a small self-defense buckler,"I recently stumbled across a video showing the applications of a small self-defense buckler:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcbqOjqiEMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcbqOjqiEMQ)

This handheld buckler could easily be used alongside a small hatchet to keep zombies at bay, defend against strikes and give one further time to strike with the hatchet.

It's also portable, light-weight, and won't impede the user's mobility nor stance positioning.

It's got the same application as an armored glove, but unlike the glove, it isn't vulnerable to zombie bites/grabs or weapon strikes from other humans.

A police station as a base and general strategy,"I've always thought that, in the event of the apocalypse, the first place I would go would be the nearest police station (note: I'm in the UK so my station might be different to yours). The reasons are numerous:

Good strong security doors designed to stand against attack

No windows on the ground floor

Advanced communication and CCTV facilities

Access to riot gear and equipment

A secure vehicle compound with gates

Canteen, medical, and recreation facilities and holding cells

Possible access to firearms (see below)

A flat roof which could be used for observation or possibly for landing a helicopter

I believe that my local station also has underground access to other buildings nearby

STRATEGY

I would use the station as a central base from which I could take over nearby buildings such as the town hall, offices, and hospital. I would build barricades across roads and fortify buildings to create a secure perimeter, defended by improvised booby traps, which would be expanded wherever possible.

I would send out salvage and reconnaissance parties to forage for food and resources and to locate any other survivors. These groups would be supported by vehicles (fuel permitting) including bicycle or motorcycle 'outriders' who could scout ahead.

FIREARMS (a note for Americans)

Traditionally, most police in the UK are not routinely armed, but there are 'rapid response' armed units specially recruited and trained to respond to terrorism/bank robberies, etc. Generally these officers can be on the scene of an incident within a few minutes and, in most cases, they don't even need to open fire. Armed police can also be found around high profile targets such as Whitehall, royal residences, airports, etc.

Among the general population, many farmers and sportsmen (such as clay pigeon shooters) have shotguns; but most firearms are in the hands of criminals. Nobody is sure how many guns are in the country but it is apparently quite easy to get one if you know the right people (usually a friend of some bloke you met down the pub). Amnesties often uncover a surprising number and range of illegally held weapons.

Personally, in a zombie scenario, I would only use guns as a last resort. They make a lot of noise which attracts more zombies, ammunition is limited, and any shot that isn't a head shot is a wasted shot. Only if zombies actually breach my perimeter would I bring guns into use (saving the last bullet for myself of course).",1,1598953507,Rufus_Everard,8,1,True,2020-09-01,"a police station as a base and general strategy i've always thought that, in the event of the apocalypse, the first place i would go would be the nearest police station (note: i'm in the uk so my station might be different to yours). the reasons are numerous:

Developing anti-bleeding compounds from bio-materials," 

*Processing video u4ms1ngdr3m51...*

Bleeding kills around 10% of the world population annually, which is greater than the number of deaths due to HIV, TB, and Malaria combined (WHO).

Minutes count! As a casualty doctor, I have seen people bleed to death in just 5 minutes and many more die on the way to the hospital. We started Miraqules to fight this global problem. We have come up with **StopBleed**, an anti-bleeding powder that stops bleeding in 40 seconds. It can also heal wounds and the best part is, it works with people having blood clotting disorders.

We would encourage you to watch the **StopBleed VS Celox** comparison video and share your valuable opinion.

Tips and tricks for a zombie apocolypse,"These are just some of my strategies for a zombie apocolypse, the ones i think would be good tips and tricks.

1. Never use a gun without a silencer
Since one hasn't happened, we have no way of knowing if zombies would be sensitive to sound. Just in case, go ahead and buy a silencer. Or wait and steal one.

2. Use melee weapons AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

this is a tip that is sort of attached to number 1. If zombies are sensitive to sound, its best to use melee to off them. Even with a silencer, a gun will still make noise.

3. Never go to places that were once very popular.

Who doesnt want to see the eiffel tower? Or the grand canyon. Well during a zombie apocolypse, zombies would be swarming at places like the aforementioned. The end of the world should never be taken as a chance to see the places you've always wanted to.

4. Steal a f×cking tank.

Tanks could easily run zombies over. Enough said.

5. Forget everything.

Heres a little scenario, you see your wife turn, do not cry, cause then she would have already bitten your head off. In an apocolypse, it would be best to cut out the emotion part of your brain and feed it to your zombie dog.

6. Dont own a zombie dog.

You would get lost in the pupper cuteness and it would eat you. Simple as that.

7. Steal army gear from a zombie

See a zombie who was in the armor? Say thanks for your service by putting him out of the miserable hell that is being a zombie, and steal his gear. 

8. Don't let people take your sh×t

Have tracking devices on everything you own, that way if something gets stolen you can hunt the thief down and shoot him in the head. What are the brain-dead zombified cops gonna do? Arrest you?

9. Ration your supplies. Bottle of water and two bacon strips on a single slice of toast. Bread is more filling

10. LEARN HOW TO MAKE BREAD.

Bread is one of the most filling food items out there, if you can make it yourself then you're good to go.

11. Never take food from strangers.

My personal survival tactic.,"So, in this scenario i would be an adult who had worked for 100k a year for 10 years and saved up 900k. Beneath my house would be a small entrance (reinforced with steel as thick as i can get) to a 2 floor, soundproof, concrete walled bunker. In it would be:

Plug sockets connected to my own power supply (solar panels for day) however to prevent power loss, only the 10 fridges/freezers would be on at night. I would have 5 pantries full of tinned food and one small room full of fish tanks full of cod. When meat is needed kill some of fish and cook them. I would have vegetables growing in a room with a one way mirror (as thick as possible) as a ceiling. This would be in a shed with a glass roof and the sunlight would help them grow, with a small amount of water supplied by me. I would connect a pipe from a lake and filter the water, before boiling it to be safe and prevent infections. I would have a few cupboards of medicine and antibiotics for emergencies, however colds would not be treated with medicine as it isn't needed. I would also have vaccines or try to get my hands on vaccine recipes for any babies that might come along. I would have a room full of weapons and ammo of all types. On the second floor, i would have the bedrooms. Each room would have a steel door that is locked at night and doesn't unlock till the morning. This system would use the solar panels to work and would open the door when it detected the solar panels making power. In case of emergencies each room would have a gun, ammo, metal baseball bat, wardrobe and an escape route. The wardrobe would have a small amount of clothing and a hazmat suit if possible to prevent bites and filter air if the virus spreads that way. If this is not possible then armour would have to do. The escape route would need a 5 digit code to open and would have a ladder leading up to the surface, the exit being covered by a small shed.

It seems to have all the perks of a good melee weapon.

Farming in the zombie apocalypse - what to grow and raise,"I was inspired by a recent poll to post this, as it seemed easy to pick “farming” for me. To me, I’m most interested in the idea of how I would provide myself with the necessities of life without modern luxuries. I currently live in the city but when I was younger I raised goats and chickens, as well as regularly tending to a garden. I’d like to share some of my thoughts. I would like to post more on this later but for now I’ll start with the basic concept - what would be most effective to grow and raise? Also I’m on mobile, I will try to format this the best I can! 

**What to Grow**

Typical back yard garden plants generally aren’t the best for survival. Typically, in most back yard gardens have things like tomatoes, watermelon, cucumbers, which are great when they’re not intended to be a major food source. When growing to feed yourself consistently, you need to select plants that are reliable, store well, and provide you with high calories and nutrition for the work you put in. The plants you grow will be your primary source of carbohydrates, which are extremely vital for brain function and are your body’s primary fuel source. Following are some of my top picks for crops, based on research and personal experience. I also don’t have the greenest of thumbs, so this will be largely based on how east something is to grow. 

Green beans and pinto beans - various green bean varieties and pinto beans easily make this list. Of the different types of green beans I’ve grown, bush beans are a favorite because of their relatively low maintenance, whereas “pole beans” produce higher yields but take more work. Pinto beans are useful for similar reasons. In my experience, you get a lot per plant and the beans can be dried and stored for a very long time. Being legumes, both green beans and pinto beans are higher in calories than most common garden vegetables and can be grown in a variety of soil types. Individual plants have many harvests throughout the season. 

Winter squash - this group includes butternut, acorn, and spaghetti squash. This group lacks the high caloric profile of other veggies on this list, it makes up for in ease to grow and storability. An anecdote for this - one summer I planted some butternut and spaghetti squash, and then broke my ankle not long after. The plants where in a raised bed. Unable to weed or care for the plants with the exception of occasional watering from my dad, I expected them to do poorly. They grew 10 feet each way and each plant yielded about 6-10 squashes. Some of those squashes lasted in a dark cupboard for 8 months. 

Potatoes - this is an obvious one. Potatoes are calorically dense, and store for a very long time. They have been a staple in human diets since we figured out how to grow them, and using techniques like “the tire method” can allow you to grow them with little space. Drawbacks - I have found them hard to grow without a solid green thumb. They’re pretty susceptible to pests and poor soil conditions.  

**What to Raise** 

You will want to raise animals that require minimal grain and feed, and can largely eat off the land. Chickens and goats easily take the top spots here. 

Chickens - there is a reason chickens have hung around as a food source. They can provide us with a consistent food source in the form of eggs, and with meat once they are no longer productive (or if they are male). For your starter flock, you want to select breeds with desirable, broad traits as they will pass those down for generations as you maintain your flock. You want to balance traits for eggs, meat, and reproductive capabilities. If you live in an area that gets cold in the winter like me, you also want cold-hardy breeds with shorter combs so you don’t lose have your flock to frost bite. My ideal starter flock would consist of the following breeds - salmon faverolles, Buckeyes, American game (hen-only 1) Cornish, barred rock, wyandotte, Rhode lsland red. Some of these break the short-comb rule, but are still considered cold-hardy and are good at foraging most of their food by free-ranging. A good variety will allow you to maintain a healthy flock even in the event that some inevitable inbreeding happens. 

Goats - these animals beat out all of the large animals for their use in a post apocalyptic situation. For starters, they are natural foragers. You don’t have to have quality grazing like with cattle or sheep and goats can provide you with milk and meat. Since they can eat brush, you don’t have to supplement quite as much in the winter. That being said, some popular goat breeds suffer severely from issues with pure-breeding, so cross breeds have become popular lately among goat enthusiasts. I would recommend the hardy Alpine goat, or a cross that includes it. An alpine-boer cross would be a good dual-purpose goat, whereas an alpine-Nubian would provide higher milk yield while avoiding some of the genetic issues with purebred Nubian goats. Pygmy and dwarf goats - and crosses of them - may suit you well if you have less space, although I have heard anecdotes that they don’t forage as well and tend to favor more lush grasses and hay. 

**conclusion** 

I hope you enjoyed my essay. Obviously this isn’t specific to a *zombie* apocalypse. Ultimately, when you’re small-scale farming as your primary food source, you need as much as you can get with as little work and risk as possible. By choosing a variety of food sources that can largely maintain themselves, you improve your chances of not starving to death. I’ve always been more interested with the survival side of things - how to eat, build, and live - than how to kill zombies.

Something I think is really overlooked when people talk about zombie survival is how useful I shields would be.,"All through history all over the world people have used shields when fighting other people. Take a modern riot shield for example, even if you're pinned in a corner with like 5 walkers on you, you hold that thing sideways and with a good arm and non of them could get close enough to bite you and with an arm free you can use whatever other weapon you have to display them one at a time. 
Not only that but think about how many people you've see die in zombie related media because they were caught off guard by a random zombie from round a corner, if you constantly have a shield by your side you've basically got a protective barrier between you and whatever up on that side at all times. 
Also think how useful one would be trying to run past multiple infected in like a corridor or something, holding the shield with two hands and bashing them down to make a quick mistake or protect your group would be an amazing advantage.
If you managed to get a bulletproof one instead you'd also be able to have constant cover from enemy fire wherever you are.

The giant problem with zombies,"People don't seem to realize something. People ask if animals can be infected, and when others say yes they just brush it off. Animals being susceptible to infection would mean the fall of humanity. Why? Mosquitoes.

Mosquitoes can survive in warm and hot climates, and also can quickly and easily reproduce. Not to mention during their prime hours at night, it's impossible to avoid them. Mosquitoes would quickly pass the infection to any mammals they can get their hands on.

Would the cold stop them? Yes... Temporarily. Keep in mind global warming. The Earth is always heating. It might take a long time, but eventually there won't be anywhere on Earth too cold for mosquitoes. At that point all mammals are doomed.

How could this be avoided? Mosquito blankets. There are blankets in existence specifically to cover yourself with to avoid mosquitoes. What we could do is modify these to work as suits. Then we have them worn fulltime. This would eliminate the threat. The problem with this is? We wouldn't be able to mass-produce them quick enough for everyone. Companies would have around a week or so after the start of the apocalypse before civilization collapses and they can no longer produce stuff. We'd have to be lucky enough for all companies to come up with the idea and start producing and selling them. But where would they sell them? After the start of the apocalypse, most stores would be shut down permanently and all be getting raided. Even if no stores closed and mosquito suits were made the second the zombies came, there wouldn't be enough time for everyone to get one. Mosquitoes would quickly infect everyone who couldn't get their hands on one. Also, the blankets work on bugs, but not other things.

How to live on a roof and survive.,"&gt;Shelter

I'd recommend what you do is get to the roof of a building without roof access via the stairs or elevators. Preferably also at least 2+ stories. If you can't do this, go to the roof of a 2+ story building with roof access and do everything you can to destroy or break the stairs and cut the elevator shaft wire, so the elevator doesn't work. This roof tactic means not many people you need to defend from, and no chance of the zombies breaking into your base. Set up a little tent on the roof, with a sleeping bag and pillow.

&gt;Entertainment

If there's outlets on the roof take advantage of them, but don't hook up extension cables from the ground floor or outside on the sidewalk, as they'll get torn up by the zombies and it also gives them something to climb to reach you. I recommend since you'll have limited access to electricity or outlets to get a giant amount of batteries, a few flashlights, and a good amount of books, games, or other things for entertainment. 

&gt;Water

Make a few rain catchers for water. 

&gt;Food

Rob a pet store for food (dog food *is* made for dogs, but most dog foods can be eaten by humans without many negative effects, and also there will be less fighting and riots at the pet store than at actual grocery stores).

&gt;Clothing

Rob some clothing stores, or if need be steal some from the corpses of people who died via non-zombie ways. The bodies will be out laying unattended on the streets so run down, undress them, grab their clothing, and return to the roof.

&gt;Sleeping

Use some towels, pillows, and blankets to make a makeshift bedding area in the tent. Snooze on that. If you need more bedding or warmth, use any extra clothes you're not using.

&gt;Warmth

Wrap yourself in some blankets and tight clothes. If you have outlets on the roof set up a heater.

&gt;Residents

Take some friends and/or family too, and maybe a dog or something to keep company (don't take a cat, as it will probably jump down and leave to either never return or be consumed by the horde).",1,1593574707,MaeBeaInTheWoods,20,1,True,2020-06-30,"how to live on a roof and survive. &gt;shelter

i'd recommend what you do is get to the roof of a building without roof access via the stairs or elevators. preferably also at least 2+ stories. if you can't do this, go to the roof of a 2+ story building with roof access and do everything you can to destroy or break the stairs and cut the elevator shaft wire, so the elevator doesn't work. this roof tactic means not many people you need to defend from, and no chance of the zombies breaking into your base. set up a little tent on the roof, with a sleeping bag and pillow.

A list of useless group members to recruit,"&gt;Always Useful

- Hunter/Gunslinger/Archer/Poacher (You need good fighters, and ranged weapons would be best)

- Bodyguard/Gatekeeper/Security (Anyone good at defense who'd be able to defend or protect a base or the other group members)

- Chef/Cook/Baker (Someone able to easily prepare and make foods, and also they'll mostlikely know what is and isn't safe to consume)

- Barista/Bartender (Same as above, but for drinks instead of food)

- Gardener/Farmer (Able to grow and tend to plants, and can grow fruits and vegetables, aka food)

- Landscaper (Without humans cutting and stopping them, plants will grow and retake the cities and towns, which is why someone who knows how to get rid of, trim, and kill plants would be good)

- Scientist/Researcher (Able to research and create stuff to combat diseases and viruses, and might even help curing zombies)

- Quantum Scientist/Nobel Prize Winner/Librarian (Knowledgeable, and the brains of the group)

- Jock/Sports Player/Karate Master (The muscle of the group, able to easily beat down zombies and other survivors, and can break windows to escape if necessary)

- Inventor/Tinkerer/Mechanic (Able to repair broken cars and other technology that might be needed)

- Pharmacist/Doctor/Nurse (Able to make and produce medicine, and knows what pills and other items are used for what)

FOOD SITUATION,"Okay so food and water are among the basic stuff for survival. Lets leave water aside because there can always be a way to filter some dirty water or if you're lucky enough to find a truck with gallons of water or some untouched store of some sort and sort yourself out with a decent sized stash of water.
But lets talk about food. Movies and shows they always show survivors-on-the-road just eating any canned food they come across. But hey, lets get real here canned food has an expiration date right? And lets suppose we're talking about like 5 years or so after everything fell apart and the apocalypse happened, what then? Canned food might as well make you sick and then what? I mean some of you would probably talk about growing crops but lets suppose a group of people aren't in a position to grow crops, I'm talking about survivors who haven't found a camp or just wanna be on their own. What food sources you guys would rely on other then canned food and vegetables? 
I often think about nuts. Because those things are like naturally built to last I think. Veggies and fruits they turn bad but nuts are like evergreen. So maybe if in a situation like this I come across some untouched store and find some there or come across a silo/storage or something for nuts....... I'm filling up everything I have with em, they're dry, nutritious, can keep me warm and are easy to carry around and a quick meal.

guns part 2,"i saw a lot of giving me advice and opinions on my post about my choice for a gun . i  appreciate and thank you all for your advice.  but here are some stuffs i left out during the first part

# 1) Laws about firearms in my country

* any person who owns a firearm must have a license ( bruh everyone knows that)
* firearm license are differed into different categories . 
* one gun license can only be register with ONE gun . meaning you need to get TWO license to get two guns (even two of the same category)
* Automatic weapons are inacessible unless you are an active military personnel , a bodyguard , a police officer or a VIP (royal family , politician , Dato \[a rank of vip in my nation\])
* violation of any law will result in death penalty 

# 2) Detachable magazines

note :this is my personal opinion on detachable magazines , i might be wrong feel free to correct me ( i welcome knowledge)

* i dont personally like detachable magazines because you need to buy separate mags and ammo , making more expenses 
* people always talk about reloading a detachable mag gun is faster but if you add up the time you put the mag into your pouch it actually dosen't benefit much unless you are trained and very experienced with your gun (which im not). magazines will be very scarce in the apocalypse so performing a mag throw is being very stupid.
* Magazines need to be reload individually , most guns cannot be used without the magazine and most guns dont provide a way to manually load rounds into the gun ( exceptions being such as the mosin , sks or m14 which uses both detachable mags and can be loaded form the top) meaning that you have to detach your magazines and reload it mid gunfight ( which i think is slower than loading tube mags)

"Challenge- You ran, you hid, and now you must fight v1","**General**
-----

This challenge is in response to the many interesting claims of being able to carry, use, wear, etc. various bits of gear, loadouts, weapons, and so on that have been made throughout the years.  The purpose of this challenge is to somewhat humble and open eyes for many to their real world capabilities for a somewhat more practical environment.

Encouraging participants to be humbled by their own physical limitations and achievements along with encouraging physical activity, proper martial training, and healthy exercise outside of this challenge.

Grading for each event will get between 1, 2, 3, and 4 points.

Feel free to share your actual times, photos, videos, etc. in the comments.  Please including a packing list and general wear for your load you wanted brought.

What I look forward to most is you feedback and how challenging you felt this little experiment was.

Remember to stretch, drink water, rest, and take as many safety precautions as possible.

**Backstory for the challenge**
----

After drawing the short straw you have been chosen to observe the area from the northern farmhouse.  This is relatively close by your group's base and acts as one of the more forward points between you and the as the crow flies distance to the nearest town.  So having eyes on the farmhouse is going to be nesscary to maintain medium range security.

It will just be three days with another memeber making a light supply run for you halfway through so going light on the supplies is alright.

**Event 1:  The short walk**
----

Inorder to begin observing the area around the farmhouse you must get to the observation area.  After two months most vehicles have fallen into disarray either from the gas being polluted with water, the oil stagnating in the engines, etc.  What little fuel your group does have and the one working car that is available isn't going to be wasted on dropping you off to watch a farmhouse.  So you're going to have to walk with your full load of water, food, weapon, and other equipment.

**Task:**  20km walk or walk in place for 29,000 steps

It's a basic walk with whatever gear, weapons, equipment, etc. that you intend to carry in our fictional apocalypse setting.  Take breaks as frequently as you need to and rest for as long as you want.

Likewise, all the basic safety precautions should be taken, you should drink water, stretch appropriately, rest and take breaks, and stop if you feel like you are in danger.  Please don't break any laws while doing this by walking around with a baseball bat or rifle in the streets, just carry a substitution of some sort.

**Scoring:**

1  More than 7 hours

2  7-6 hours

3  6-5 hours

4  Less than 5 hours

**Event 2:  I'm up, he sees me, I'm down**
-----

As you close in on your destination you need to cross an open field.  In order to do so while evading possible enemy detection or fire you decide need to move in short bounding actions.  With weapon in hand you will begin sprinting forward quickly before ducking in the grass, waiting, and then getting up to sprint again.  Keeping your head on a swivel scanning for danger and the possibility of being spotted.

**Task:**  150m sprint or 60 side straddle hop/jumping jacks

And an additional 20 burpees/squat thrusts

I highly suggest using a weapon substitute(s) here as you run with your weapon(s) in hand.  During the burpees the weapon remains in your hand(s) only putting it down as you squad down to perform each burpee and picking it up as you stand up and jump.

Likewise, all the basic safety precautions should be taken, you should drink water, stretch appropriately, rest and take breaks, and stop if you feel like you are in danger.  Please don't break any laws while doing this by running around with a baseball bat or rifle in the streets, just carry a substitution of some sort.

**Scoring:**

1  More than 3:30min

2  3:30-2:00min

3 2:10-1:50min

4 Under 1:50min

**Event 3:  Fighting Shadows**
----

You were spotted on your way to the farmhouse.  A small cell of a handful of zombies you will need to clear so your supply run doesn't have to deal with them and risk getting injured.  Drop your pack as they should be relatively short work.

**Task:**  2 minute of jabs with your weapon(s)

2 minute of crosses with your weapon(s)

2 minute of side, straight, and shovel kicks

1 minute of pushups

1 minute of supine bicycle

and 1 minute of crunches.

Take off your load to begin the event.  Basic description of each event:

Jabs are any basic light striking you can do with your weapon to create space.  They are a simple movement without much weight or follow through.

Crosses have the motion from your hips and follow through to add more power in the hits.

The various kicks are cycled through as best you can remember their order.

Knee supported push ups do not count, keep your back straight, and they only count if your body passes your elbows.

Supine bicycles are counted on the same leg so if you kick out starting with your left leg then only the left leg is used for counting.  You must go from the crunched position with your elbow touching your knee to flat on your back and return to the crunch.

**Score:**

1  Less than 10 push ups, 15 supine bicycle, and 15 crunches.

2  10-15 push ups, 15-25 supine bicycle, and 15-25 crunches.

3  15-25 push ups, 25-35 supine bicycle, and 25-35 crunches.

4  More than 25 push ups, more than 35 supine bicycle, and more than 35 crunches.

**Event Final:  Brief respite**
----

You have to sleep some time.

**Task:**

Utilizing what you have with you set up a basic camp.  It might be in your yard or inside your house.  Just remember to turn off any airconditioning or creature comforts you might have.

The ideal vehicle for a z-apocalypse?,"So, the wold has gone to shit, but by some kind of fortune, you can choose absolutely ANY kind of (ground) vehicle freely. From a main battle tank to a prius or such, and everything inbetween. Even bicycles, horses or horsecarts. An MBT, IFV or similar would of course have a lot of advantages, but would be a nightmare to keep fueled. A prius would be fucked if you had to go offroad or you got caught by a horde, but could drive forever on what would only get the MBT around a few blocks. 

The only limitation is that it must be a real vehicle, something that does exist or have existed.

Also - remember that anything running on regular fossile fuel would only be possible to use for a while, until the fuel supplies go bad, (which is not very long, a few months unless its stored in perfect conditions and have had special stabilizer added), while multifuel engines might be possible to keep running at some level if we manage to get nearly any kind of light oil. Electric vehicles wont run out of fuel as long as we manage to generate power, which is quite a bit easier than to pump up oil and refine it. BUT - in return they will probably take a lot longer to charge than just regulering a fossile fuel vehicle. Every choice comes with advantages and disadvantages :)

And yeah, we are presuming the walking dead kinda zombies.

So - what would be your dreamride for the z-apocalypse?

Day 3 of the Zompocalypse,"After heavily securing your home for the first two days of the outbreak, you decide that saying put is a safer bet than an emergency shelter that's probably become a hot spot for zombies chasing their next meal. You have enough food to last almost a month on your own, and your suburban neighborhood has been relatively quiet today after the initial chaos from the days earlier. This is reassuring, since you've planned on staying put unless you absolutely have to leave. Some supplies will be necessary to survive this. And so will some weapons. You could use a way to filter or distill water, and perhaps grow a garden in your backyard. Maybe some solar panels to get electricity back on.

"Afternoon, day 3 of zompocalypse","Gear: crank radio, lighter, backpack, pocket knife, first aid kit, flashlight, multitool, antibiotics
Weapon: crowbar
Vehicle: hatchback sedan w/full tank
Rations: 41 days worth

With your home heavily fortified and a plan to stay bughed in for the time being, you decide to search the neighborhood for supplies first and foremost, keeping an eye out for zombies and for any survivors. You're cautious about the living, and fearful of the undead. You start early in the morning going through alleys and backyards hiding behind fences and homes. Your next door neighbors' home has it's frontdoor wide open and you recall seeing that family quickly stow bags into their minivan and leave in a hurry on the first day of the zompocalypse. In their haste they may have left something of use. You search the house and find nothing useful...until you search the garage. You find packets of veggie seeds, some gardening tools and gardening books and quickly bring them home before searching the neighbor's house across the street. You search that house, and several others, finding no survivors but finding 2 weeks worth of rations, a first aid kit, some prescription antibiotics, and a metal gun safe in a neighbor's bedroom closet. The crowbar you have seems like it would be ineffectual, but you consider trying to pry open the safe. You also consider searching for lower hanging fruit in other houses. And you also want to get a start on a garden and setting up rain barrels and an irrigation system in the backyard. What do you do before returning to your fortified home for the night?

[Weapon:Crowbar][Gear:backpack, lighter, flashlight, first aid kit, antibiotics, multitool, crank radio,] [Vehicle:hatchback sedan w/full tank] [Rations:38 days]  You've prioritized setting up your home for long term survival. After heavily fortifying your home and the fenced in backyard, you created a backyard garden that's  sprouting vegetable plants with an irrigation system fed by rain barrels. You've also prioritized searching the neighborhood for supplies and survivors, and a means of breaking into a gunsafe left in a neighbor's abandoned home. While searching homes you found plenty of foodstuffs and household supplies as an 11 amp drill, tungsten carbite bits and a generator to break into the safe. The only problem is, more zombies have been migrating from the city into the surrounding suburbs looking for food, often chasing after the few survivors who survived the chaos there. You've been incredibly cautious of the survivors you've seen and heard coming through your neighborhood. The first clue that survivors were in the area was finding homes raided that you hadn't been to yet. Then nearby gunshots and screams. Then finding fresh corpses shot in the head...too fresh to have been zombie. These people were desperate, and have probably done terrible things to survive this long out there. And now the streets of your suburb are scattered with the undead. Leaving your home to scavenge is getting harder, and although you've only had to kill a few zombies so far, you know that it's starting to get much more dangerous out there. You need better weapons, and an escape plan if things get out of hand. And you need to make your home safer to avoid letting things get that bad. Today, you plan to set up the generator, drill, duffel bags and a decoy to break into the safe and safely escape with the goods. The safe is large and heavy, possibly bolted to the floor so moving it is impossible and the drilling has to happenin the upstairs bedroom. The problem with drilling and running the generator is the noise. You set up a stereo system in a garage down the street with extension cords so you can turn that on as a distraction after drilling through the safe. You kick on the genny and start drilling. Within a few minutes you've drilled through the lock and kill the genny, swinging open the safe and stuffing guns and ammo into duffel bags. In the safe is a semiauto AR-15 rifle with a dozen loaded mags and a red dot with flip up magnifier, a glock 17 with 8 loaded mags and holster, a semiauto AKM with a dozen loaded mags and a red dot with flip up magnifier , a ruger 10/22 with a dozen loaded mags and a red dot with flip up magnifier, an autoloader benelli shotgun with 100 shells of buckshot and slugs and a red dot, and a kimber 1911 with 8 loaded mags and a holster.  You stuff all of it into the duffel bags, plug the decoy stereo into the generator,  and head down the stairs to the sound windows smashing and groans. A dozen zombies have surrounded the house and are after you! You run back up the stairs and throw the duffel bags out a window, jumping down onto the side of the house with no zoms. You grab the bags and run to your house, slamming the door and barricading it.  looking out from the window you see that almost 50 zoms have taken to the streets nearby searching for you. Most are going after the stereo down the road, but several that saw you make a B-line for your house. What do you do?

INTRODUCING: FUCK THE RULES FRIDAY,"I have an exciting announcement to make! We are creating a meme posting day!

So, in response to a particularly amusing [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZombieSurvivalTactics/comments/gkmdgf/uh_i_guess_thats_a_good_way_to_get_rid_of_zombies/) climbing to the #4 position of our top all time ranking (not to mention just being fucking hilarious), I'm going to start allowing memes/shitposts on Fridays!

What does this mean? Essentially, all posts on Friday will have the rules much more leniently applied.

* You want to post a picture of gear for the sake of it being cool? Do it on friday.
* You wanna post an absurd zombie movie/game clip? Do it on friday.
* You wanna post a gif of a guy blowing his house to fuck (with him inside) to clear out the undead? You guessed it; Friday.

Zombies in ParaNorman,"Hello everyone. How are you doing? I wouldn't bother you, but it turns out that I don't have any friends whose native language is English. So I was wondering if you could help me. I am studying now anglistic and have to write an essay. But I am quite struggling to it as I have been taught different writing discourse. Could you please be so kind as to have a look or maybe you have a friend who is bored in quarantine and doesn't mind reading some strange stuff about zombies. Yes, it is my topic.  Thank you in advance.

Zombies and xenophobic attitude in the film “ParaNorman”.

As a child I liked to watch horror films, because of the bewitching and attractive-pleasant feeling that arises when watching them. But not always I could see the hidden context hidden in the mysterious frightening lines and cues of the heroes of the film. Now, watching all the same films, I perceive them in a completely different way. Sometimes it is very difficult to see the hidden subtext, and yet in this essay, I am analyzing the appearance of intolerant, xenophobic attitude that is shown in one of my favorite animated film “ParaNorman”.

Coming from Laika one of the two greats stop-motion studios, “ParaNorman” is a story for children about consciences of giving and taking the time to listen to each other and death. A protagonist, that teach us, Norman does not fit in. He is obsessed with horror movies, quiet, introverted and he can see dead people. Something which gets him a lot of suspension glaze from his neighbors and open hostility from his father. In fact, in the first scene with Norman and his parents, we see that “ParaNorman” is not only fun to look at, but it is also telling us something important. Norman’s parents don’t see eye to eye with him, what he can see nobody else can and because of that, even his closest to him are unable and unwilling to treat him with any respect or consideration. And the theme of people not bothering to understand things that confuse them recourse throughout the film. Norman lives in a small town, that is similar to Samen, Massachusetts.

There are witch theme restaurants and gift shops and even statue in a town square, which brings us to one of the film's greatest strength. It shows us how terrible the townspeople are with the idea of seeing cruelty that stands from the assumption that anything different is bad and must be treated with open hostility. “ParaNorman” takes one step further by involving the audience in the same discrimination, the story is warning against. We are showing the statue in the storm before we know the truth about the witch. So naturally, we assume that the witch is the same evil we have been presented with, but she is not. It is revealing that the witch was just a little girl who, like Norman, could speak to the dead. And the townspeople killed her for it. 300 years later Norman is faced with the same intolerance and even place into it himself assuming as we do that the witch was evil when in fact, she was just like him.

It is telling then that Norman power is not flight or super strength, it is the ability to talk to people that nobody else can communicate with. In the end, the only person who can stop the witch's curse is Norman because he can talk to the dead, the very thing that made him unsocial, tent out to be the thing that the town desperately needs, Norman’s gift is being able to talk to people and everybody else is not taking time to talk, which is funny when they’re angrily fighting with terrifying zombies who are just trying to talk to Norman.

I had recourse to threat theories to explain the negative intolerant xenophobic attitude to zombies. The social order that determines the relationship of people in our world, regardless of a variety of cultural customs and traditions, has for centuries been asked by the universal psychological alternative “we and they”. The key to difficult survival was the creation of closed ""we-groups"" and a wary or hostile attitude towards all other ""they-groups."" A person’s desire to divide the world into “we” and “they” is one of the basic features of human nature and the central psychological mechanism of xenophobia.

Xenophobia often turns into a socially dangerous psychological phenomenon: when differences between people themselves begin to be perceived as a problem when they are afraid of these differences - then “strangers” from “others” turn into “aliens”, cause fear and are perceived as a threat to our positive identity and habitual way of life. Fear breeds hostility, which can turn into hatred and hostility. And then the psychological mechanism “we are them” is fully activated and determines the formation of negative stereotypes and prejudices, repulsive images of the enemy, various forms of discrimination, and becomes the reason for the “witch hunt” and the search for “scapegoats”

To summarise, ParaNorman is great because it can help people who feel like freaks to feel more ok about being different and maybe feel a little less alone. The real villains of the film aren’t any of these strange or ugly zombies. In fact, the zombies were much more violent when they were still alive. These living people are horrible because they are scared of what they don’t understand, not because they are bad people. Lack of understanding and empathy that causes all the problems in the film. Fundamentally tolerant worldview is determined by materialistic values that are formed in the individual depending on the level of existential well-being, experienced by him during the years of his formation. It is this fact that makes the country level of tolerant sentiments in each period enough stable.

The best weapon is avoidance,"There is a lot of discussion on here as far as the best weapons against zombies, like types of guns, bows, knives, etc. But although it’s less fun to think about, avoiding combat is much more realistic. 

The way I see it, engaging in combat almost always puts you at a higher risk than fleeing. Assuming that we’re talking about the generally accepted, slow moving, have-to-destroy-the-brain zombie, there is almost always ample opportunity to get out of combat, but once engaged, you are at a major disadvantage. You have a very small area to hit, you have to penetrate the skull and destroy a very specific part of the brain, where as a zombie just has to bite or scratch you somewhere and you’re done for. If you’re already in close combat, you’re basically fucked. In almost every scenario, you have better chances to GTFO. 

Even at a distance, head shots with a rifle on moving targets are difficult and take a lot of practice. With a bow and arrow, it’s even harder as the arrows are slower and you must account for wind and distance. IMO it’s also best to save these resources for gathering food whenever possible.

I believe that against a zombie the quarterstaff could easily do enough blunt force damage to the skull / brain to kill a zombie quite effectively.

"""Project Greenwood"" A Zombie Survival Audiobook","This is a prologue of my current audiobook zombie audiobook series

  

Wednesday June 4th the day Project Greenwood was initiated. 

It was somewhere around June 2018 when Nebraska and most of the Midwest suffered one of the most serious droughts since the dust bowl in the 1930s it was believed this happened due to a series of massive abnormal CME’s or Coronal Mass ejections of the sun. However, scientists were baffled on why these CME’s only caused minor damage to electronics and the power grid. However, it was enough to cause temperatures to rise in most Midwestern states and cause rainfall levels to fall far below normal. The dry powdered dirt from nearby fields blew through the air making it unbearable to breathe and be outside, dust storms obscured the sun so much making day into night. Many people developed breathing issues from the dust storms and it was now mandatory to wear masks.  Farms were affected greatly as they suffered from loss of crops and cattle. The soil was to dry and farmers tried many methods to grow crops. All their traditional fertilizers were also failing. I, My wife and my son lived in Southern Greenwood County it was not so bad here with the dust but the drought had wreaked havoc on local food supplies and other essentials, people hoarded medicines, water, and hell even toilet paper this caused a lot of grocery stores to close and even other businesses.  Across the rest of the country, factories started to close along with restaurants and other merchants. People were starting to become unstable as many were hungry and no longer could afford food, riots broke out at local food markets and other stores across the country most law enforcement was overwhelmed so much all forms of law was now needed. The U.S government implemented food rations in some areas that were hit hardest by the drought. However, this was not working anymore and the government needed a better solution. With farms being unable to grow crops and traditional fertilizers failing the U.S government settled on the plan to develop their own genetically modified fertilizer. With Nebraska being a major part of the breadbasket of America they decided to test this new fertilizer in a farm in my town called Greenwood. The government calling this Project greenwood went on with the test spray of the Trimoxodone -Z425 today at 5 P.M. It was now a waiting game for the U.S to find out if this new fertilizer would actually help the problem, however we would not know of the success rate until a year from now. Would this fertilizer replenish our farms with fresh crops, would this solve the worlds hunger problem?

it was somewhere around june 2018 when nebraska and most of the midwest suffered one of the most serious droughts since the dust bowl in the 1930s it was believed this happened due to a series of massive abnormal cme’s or coronal mass ejections of the sun. however, scientists were baffled on why these cme’s only caused minor damage to electronics and the power grid. however, it was enough to cause temperatures to rise in most midwestern states and cause rainfall levels to fall far below normal. the dry powdered dirt from nearby fields blew through the air making it unbearable to breathe and be outside, dust storms obscured the sun so much making day into night. many people developed breathing issues from the dust storms and it was now mandatory to wear masks.  farms were affected greatly as they suffered from loss of crops and cattle. the soil was to dry and farmers tried many methods to grow crops. all their traditional fertilizers were also failing. i, my wife and my son lived in southern greenwood county it was not so bad here with the dust but the drought had wreaked havoc on local food supplies and other essentials, people hoarded medicines, water, and hell even toilet paper this caused a lot of grocery stores to close and even other businesses.  across the rest of the country, factories started to close along with restaurants and other merchants. people were starting to become unstable as many were hungry and no longer could afford food, riots broke out at local food markets and other stores across the country most law enforcement was overwhelmed so much all forms of law was now needed. the u.s government implemented food rations in some areas that were hit hardest by the drought. however, this was not working anymore and the government needed a better solution. with farms being unable to grow crops and traditional fertilizers failing the u.s government settled on the plan to develop their own genetically modified fertilizer. with nebraska being a major part of the breadbasket of america they decided to test this new fertilizer in a farm in my town called greenwood. the government calling this project greenwood went on with the test spray of the trimoxodone -z425 today at 5 p.m. it was now a waiting game for the u.s to find out if this new fertilizer would actually help the problem, however we would not know of the success rate until a year from now. would this fertilizer replenish our farms with fresh crops, would this solve the worlds hunger problem?

Fencing kit as protection,"I had an idea, could the gear used for protection in fencing (the sport) be good for protecting against zombie bites/scratches. Its designed to stop blades etc from piecing the clothes and getting to the skin underneath. Another key point, it is designed for sport wear, so it is flexible and easy to move around in.

Typically fencers wear a jacket, a breeches (3/4 trousers), helmet and gloves. See here:
https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/354165958173140879/

Issues i see with some of this are the helmet is only for the front, and the mesh might let blood and spit in, and the breeches (trousers) only go 3/4 of the way down. Yoi could wear something lile tall boots or football shinpads to protect your legs.

I reckon pilae like weapons would be very effective against the undead.,"Pilae were javelin like weapons employed by roman legionnaires which had a hard tip but soft shaft, meaning when it hit a shield it would bend and be incredibly heavy, causing them to drop the shield.

No reloading.

No jamming.

No missing. (Like how would it even be possible to miss someone with a battleaxe?)

I Wrote my first Zombie story! Tell me what you think!," 

I\`m not a native English speaker, so expect grammatical errors here and there when you read it. Now about: My story. 

Fortunately, I overcome my laziness, took out my ideas from my brain, put them down on the paper (Well, Microsoft Word, but you get it) and finally wrote a prologue for it. Hopefully, I will finish it before I become 30.

Now, I am amateur at the best when it comes to writing, therefore the same rank goes to the story: it\`s written by the amateur: Don\`t expect much. It's filled with flaws, grammar is awful and I know that. What I want you guys to pay the attention to, is the storytelling. I had few goals in my mind when I was writing this and hope that i have accomplished at least half of these.

The Story belongs to ""Zombie apocalypse ""genre (there are no creatures that can be defined as traditional zombies in it but I guess this is the genre it belongs to and the one I should put it in)

My goals in the prologue were:

1)To show how hopeless the whole situation is, from the random civilian viewpoint.

2)To show how hunting and frightening the infected can be.

3)To show how brutal and messed up, the story can get.

4)To make Krista\`s emotions and fears believable, and make you feel sorry for her and her brother.

5)To make the main character feel mysterious and brutal.

6)To make you want to know more about the world and the main character.

7)To make you question things and have desire for more knowledge.

8)To describe the scenes according to the situation.

9)To not write anything cliché.

10)To not write anything useless and unneeded.

11)To make you want to read more.

This is it I guess? Yeah, the link is below so you can go, check it out and tell me how many of my goals did I successfully/unsuccessfully accomplished. Do make sure to remember that, I'm an amateur, so please go easy on me. :D

My plan for survival,"Ok so I live on a veryyyyy small island. There’s on one way to enter/exit, a single bridge. and then from the bridge there’s another section of island connected to another bridge.

As for food and water supply, boil salt water and eat fish. We also have a nice deer population and other smaller rodents. I’d say turn the school into the main control building of sorts, because it’s in the middle of the island. Perhaps move the doctors office there. We could turn part of the school into a place for the old, weak, and dying, that way its easier to keep tracks of potential zombie candidates.

You are a Leader of 100 survivors.what would you do,"You live in a small town when news breaks that a zombie apocalypse has begun only 50 miles (80km) away from you.

It’s a Sunday 5pm.

You know that you don’t have much time, so you panicked and rounded up your family and important things you need (realistically what did you take?)

You didn’t go to any shops or supermarkets because you thought they would be over populated and be too risky.
 
You are scared and think going on foot would be safer as driving a car isn’t safe (becoming a target and a limit of gas also noise)

You and your family meet up at one of your houses  and decide the best option is to go to the local doctors office  (out of the way of main places, others won’t think of this, medical resources , it’s Sunday 5pm it’s shut)

DESCRIPTION of building 
There is 4 windows and 2 doors one front and one back.
IMAGINE the building Is 20x10 meters
[Imagine the building is 20x10meters](https://www.smartdraw.com/healthcare-facility-plan/examples/outpatient-clinic-facility-plan/)
The roof is flat (great for rain water)
Only 1 entrance to the premiss with a spiked fence around it.



You and your family make your way into the premises and see that’s it’s closed as it is Sunday. You break 1 of the windows to enter. 

Do you do multiple trips home to bring more stuff?

While setting up you see  a large group of people approaching towards the building you decide it’s best to try and be friendly (they out man you and they can be help) you become friendly and they begin helping you defend the building 

Day 6 
You have been declared leader of the group 

The building is defended (how have you defended the building) 

Over the past few days you have let some people in 

You now have 29 people under your command 

Here is your team 
5 middle aged woman (1 with military background)
6 middle aged men (2 with military background)
2elderly women 
3 elderly men (1 with military background)
3young females (ages 2 5 7)
3young males ( ages 2 5 10)
4female teenagers ( 13 15 16 16)
3 male teenagers (14 16 19)
And you!

With all the resources put together you have food for another 20 days but water for only 6 days 

You have plenty of hand weapons (axes, shovels , bats and more)
You have 7 firearms 
1 shotgun(Winchester with limited ammo)
1 Ar (AR-15 with around 10 magazines)
5 sidearms (all take same ammo with over a thousand bullets in total)


Final things 

You have seen zombies and  you know killing the brain kills the zombie.


Do you trust everyone( do you hide food and weapons?

What’s your end game plan?

You now have to decide on roles for everybody and there strategy

 For example 

Scavengers 1 man and 1 woman with military experience, 2 men and 1 male teenager. 

Job is to make there way around the town to scavenge for food and other resources 

I leave 1 military man at base as he can defend the others.

How would you survive a Zombie Apocalypse during the 'Day to Day'?,"I've tried looking it up, but there aren't many that talk about the nitty gritty day-to-day things we need during an apocalypse, especially in family groups. Offering a bit of a hypothetical situation to give an idea of what I'm asking...

Your government and military has lost most of it's foothold during the initial outbreak roughly 5 years ago, and has been kicked back to a fraction of it's former glory, but is expanding. They can create the most necessary items such as medicine, cloth, fuel, and ammunition. These items are often traded out to settlements to encourage peaceful expansion, so you can get ahold of these vital items through trade (or theft). But you don't want to live with your government because of the restriction of rights, food rationing, less than pleasant living or work conditions, and a constant state of Martial Law and fear of abuse of power.

You are part of a family of four, dad, mom, son and daughter (both young adults), and still have to take care of each other (family is all you have left). You have to provide for the family in ways beyond just putting food on the table. You have no electricity or plumbing, and only live near a settlement (because you like your privacy), but laundry needs done, dishes need washed, some form of sanitary conditions must be met. A cold won't kill you, but a sick member can't go out on excursions to hunt or forage (might draw unwanted attention with a sneeze), and shouldn't be left home alone for fear of looters or raiders (non zombie threats).

Think about the area you live in, or a local country area you've been to. What do you have around you that will help you survive? What items will you have to make from scratch and how would you do it? How would you ensure you have enough food in the winter months if hunting gets sparse? How will you make sure you have items worthy of trade to get the essentials? What easily accessible things can you use to protect your home? From the unwelcomed undead or simply unsavory types.

Note: Lets say in this scenario the zombies are standard shufflers. Infection spreads through saliva and blood. The virus can survive in water for a few months or indefinitely if infected flesh is in the water or upstream (Long term exposer to heat like a rolling boil will kill the virus). Recently infected people are contagious but don't have any symptoms, and can take about two weeks to progressively turn IF they survive the initial infection of the bite.

Many won't make it after five days,"A provocative statement, I know.

Here's where I'm coming from. I've been a fan of the TV show Alone for a long time and one of the things  that happens, over and over (and over) are people tapping out within a few days. These people  say they're outdoorsmen/women, experienced woodscraft, etc., and after a couple of days they're crying about missing their families, or making rookie mistakes, getting hurt, or making themselves sick.

I'm no outdoor expert, but I've been in the wild, on my own and while all these experts recite the same thing, ""water, shelter, fire, food"" (that order can change depending on the environment) very few include the importance of mental attitude. Acceptance, the will to survive, fostering hope or optimism, and managing expectations.  I'm sure you can think of other important ones, but you get my point.

These people are real-world examples. So I feel safe to say if the worst ever happens, you're either going to end up with a lot of people gathering around you for company, or the people trying to make it on their own are going to dye off in no time.

How to survive a fast zombie apocalypse,"Those of you familiar with zombie survival tactics will know that killing the undead is far more difficult than typically depicted in media, with reliable headshots being difficult under the best of circumstances, and weapons that can pierce the skull or slice off a head being rare and rather tiring to use. All of these complications occur with slow moving, rigor mortis type zombies. Then give them the ability to sprint. There's really no stopping them at that point. The sad reality is that in the event of a zombie outbreak where the infected could move like adrenaline junkies we are all almost certainly fucked.

However, there is one, and only one strategy that can help us officially unfuck ourselves.

                **Find a safe place to hide and stay there**

Combating one fast zombie would be trying. Prolonged combat with a group would be suicide. Evasion and stealth are going to be your best friends here- if the infected don't know where you are or can't get in they will not be able to get to you. If you happen to be somewhere safe when you learn of the outbreak, lock all the doors and windows, close the blinds, and minimize all light, sound and stimulus that leave your shelter. If you're able to construct barricades without drawing attention do so, but keep in mind the volume level and err on the side of caution. Fill all available containers with water and make yourself comfortable, because you're in for a long wait.

The most natural place to attempt this is your home, as it is familiar, unlikely to attract other people to compete for it and thus attention, violent strangers and zombies. However, it is very likely that your home could not withstand even a brief assault from the typical fast zombie. If you have an attic with a retractable ladder the best move would be to quickly and quietly move all of your supplies (prioritize food, water and weapons) up into the attic and then stay there, out of sight and out of reach. If not isolate the most defensible room in the house and fortify it as best you can. 

If you're a crazy prepper you could take some precautions to make your house more fortifiable- size up all your windows and have steel shutters pre-made and stored in your house that would cover them, for instance. You could also either construct doors that have [pull handles](https://www.cheshirehardware.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/500x500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/a/carlisle-studio-h-chrome-door-pull-handles-aa16.jpg) or keep pre-made handles to be quickly and quietly attached to the door or the wall around it once the outbreak has begun, assuming you have the carpentry skills to make that happen. This will allow you to slide a metal or wooden bar between the handles to keep the door from opening- sliding a barrier in makes less noise than hammering one and has the benefit of being easy to remove when it's time to leave.

Generally when you construct barricades you want to do so with escape in mind. But in this case if you go outside you're almost certainly going to die so you should prioritize durability for the most part. This has downsides- if there's a fire or chemical waste hazard or anything else that would make your safe house untenable you're probably going to die. But since that's already the case I'd argue that you aren't losing much.

                     **Starving the Zombies and not yourself**

The corollary to the 'fast zombie' hypothesis is that the zombies are still 'alive' in some sense, just rabid and highly infectious. Of course, all this is fictional and hypothetical so if the scenario is zombies that are undead and speed demons then they will most likely starve you out, but the idea that a living body could operate for years with no regard for its health and presumably little to no nourishment is even more absurd to me than the rising of the dead and subversion of thermodynamics seen in more standard zombie fare.

If the zombies are infected and too rabid to properly feed themselves then eventually they are going to starve. If they actually suffer from rabies like symptoms and the associated hydrophobia they'll probably die from dehydration in 3 days or less, and even people are infected in waves it will probably only take 1-2 weeks for almost all the infected to die off, but that would be too easy. Assuming that the infected can drink and have access to some water (perhaps through the rain, or natural bodies of water, or artificial) then starvation is the name of the game, and depending on the circumstances it could take 2 months from the start for the first infected to die, though their condition will deteriorate over that time. To be safe, as some survivors of the initial chaos will inevitably succumb later to form another wave of infected, you'll want to be able to stay in place for 3-4 months. Assuming a caloric intake of 2000 calories per day ( you'll want to minimize physical activity to drop your expenditure, run the numbers [here](https://tdeecalculator.net) to see how many you burn now). When rationing, if worst comes to worst stored fat can make up the deficit but only so far. There are approximately 3500 calories in a pound of fat. Running a deficit of 500 calories per day gets you down a lb/week. However, your body needs a certain level of body fat to operate properly- if you're a man generally 3-5% of your total body weight and if you're a woman 10-14%. If you dip below this number you will experience health problems and possibly starve. Use [this](https://www.calculator.net/body-fat-calculator.html) to see how much body fat you have and estimate how much you can afford to lose. You'll likely lose some muscle as well, which will negatively impact your ability to fight and evade zombies, unless you're well stocked enough to eat at maintenance or even a caloric surplus and have a sufficient training regimen.

Since your safe house is most likely you're home the best thing you can do is have sufficient food stores to last you the length of the outbreak. Most people have 3 days worth of food or less in their. Having things like dry grains and pasta, canned goods, packaged dry goods can up these numbers significantly. Ideally you would have around 200,000 calories worth of stores per person, with appropriate quantities of protein, fat and carbohydrates to ensure some level of health.

If you have a safe and well stocked place to stay your odds of survival are actually fairly decent. If you don't, you're dead.

What type of people do you recruit?,"And for anybody not specific (friends, family members, etc.) what type of skills do they have that you like?

Personally I would do family members get them together along with cousins next I would try to get friends.

For specific people I want I would go for

Medic - for any other injuries not related to a bite.

Construction worker - fortification to bases.

The “nerd” - The one that lived for this moment and knows exactly what to do.

Military guy - someone that is good with guns can help with fighting off zombies and people.

Military instructor - someone that can teach us military skills we can use to survive.

Welder - modifications to weapons could turn the tide of the battle not to mention car upgrade.

Gardener - I know basic gardening, but I would like someone that knows the best way to garden.

Influencer - someone to keep us going especially if someone just died.

Entertainer - unless we have cards and other games this guy will make the apocalypse more enjoyable.

Some people that are optional for me are

Police officer - if it’s not military, but the next best thing I’ll take it.

Teacher - if it’s someone to teach other kids, but most people could probably do that anyways.

Checking in,"So, I'm a NYC Resident and am at high risk for alien invasion, giant monster, and zombie outbreak.

Please let me know how I should respond to a zombie outbreak, and what my goals should be

===

Resources:

I live in Midtown West on the 10th floor of a 700sqft studio across from a strip club.

1ft of concrete on all sides with a steel door.

I have an SLA 3D Printer ( related chemicals ), Sewing Machine, PVC Piping, EVA Foam, Battery Powered Saw + Hammer Drill, General Tools ..  A kitchen knife ?

I also have two Fencing Uniforms, complete with Mesh Helmets, Neck Guards

I have steel toe boots, and steel toe tennis shoes.  The fencing uniforms only reach to the knees.

I have a friend who always has my GPS location and has encyclopedic levels of knowledge ..  But he lives in Queens.

===

Obstacles:

My fridge is always empty, I also cannot cook.  My freezer has some Ice pops.

I have very little contact with the outside world and I believe my first contact might be from a delivery person or checking for packages.  I will probably be one of the last people to know of a zombie outbreak and very hungry.

I have three people valuable to me that I need to keep safe:

please let me know how i should respond to a zombie outbreak, and what my goals should be

===

resources:

i live in midtown west on the 10th floor of a 700sqft studio across from a strip club.

1ft of concrete on all sides with a steel door.

i have an sla 3d printer ( related chemicals ), sewing machine, pvc piping, eva foam, battery powered saw + hammer drill, general tools ..  a kitchen knife ?

i also have two fencing uniforms, complete with mesh helmets, neck guards

i have steel toe boots, and steel toe tennis shoes.  the fencing uniforms only reach to the knees.

i have a friend who always has my gps location and has encyclopedic levels of knowledge ..  but he lives in queens.

===

obstacles:

my fridge is always empty, i also cannot cook.  my freezer has some ice pops.

i have very little contact with the outside world and i believe my first contact might be from a delivery person or checking for packages.  i will probably be one of the last people to know of a zombie outbreak and very hungry.

i have three people valuable to me that i need to keep safe:

\- one will either be in nyu or in new jersey, she is in rotc

\- one will be uptown working in an apple store or at home playing games, he is pretty jacked and pretty smart

\- one lives in the same building as me and is the owner of other fencing uniform ..  she ice skates ?  does that matter ?"

I have a special scenario for you,"The zombie virus is airborne in a kind of pore (not unlike in The Last Of Us).

However, this means they are fairly strong and can run for a long time, unless they sprint for too long and their muscles give way.

Long term survival,"I'll start with that my home is in small town. It's near few parks with big terrain , but it's also surrounded by 3 hotels. It is an old (it was build in 1920s) house with massive walls ( something about 70 cm wide in most points ) with a few staircases to that. The first staircase wouldn't be hard to barricade, because it has super heavy doors and after doors there is also staircase inside and another doors ( they aren't too massive but still ) so staircase inside can be barricaded easly as we have few big wardrobes that could be placed there. As there is also another staircase ( I will call it 'weak' ) to living part it would be the worst part of the house. Let me explain, as the first staircase leads to heavy doors and next staircase, this staircase leads to also heavy doors but its possible to get though window. If the pandemic will start with some cooldown till it will be in our town there's poaaibility to destroy them. The plot is fenced from all sides so it would be first 'filter' for the creatures.

So if you know about house I'll tell about tactic. It might not be good one but it has some chances. We at the time have water for about 200 days (for 3 people) and some medic kits ( the cheap ones from markets but still ). We are planning on buying big amount of canned food as it also has some water inside. With the amount of hotels near by it probably will become impossible to go and find some other food than what we have inside. With barricaded first staircase and the 'weak' staircase destroyed its almost impossible for zombies to get in ( till they aren't like those from Brad Pitt's World War Z movie ). With decent amount of zombies outside it would be hard to find any other groups just running by. Even if they were there they still wouldn't come insode of our house because from outside it looks like it was in very bad condition.

So let's say we survived the pandemic's start and let' say we successfully destroyed the 'weak' and we also have stored food and water for those 200 days (we got big storing space that's in living part) Are there cons of this 'tactic' I mean during pandemic everything can happen but let's say our food is good, there's no electricity and there's few dozens of zombies outside the plot. Even let's say nothing bad happen during those 200 days what now? What else can we do after surviving like 98% of civilization. Do we just starve? What is the point of surviving 200 days with risk everywhere with no weapons ( by weapons I mean things more like guns. We could use only hammers and knifes if something happen ) is it better than surviving those 3 days or less? Zombies surly would get weaker after like 140 days with small amounts of food but they would still exist. What civilization will become? Small groups of people that will do anything to survive? We still won't have chances, even after those 200 days or even year or so.

so if you know about house i'll tell about tactic. it might not be good one but it has some chances. we at the time have water for about 200 days (for 3 people) and some medic kits ( the cheap ones from markets but still ). we are planning on buying big amount of canned food as it also has some water inside. with the amount of hotels near by it probably will become impossible to go and find some other food than what we have inside. with barricaded first staircase and the 'weak' staircase destroyed its almost impossible for zombies to get in ( till they aren't like those from brad pitt's world war z movie ). with decent amount of zombies outside it would be hard to find any other groups just running by. even if they were there they still wouldn't come insode of our house because from outside it looks like it was in very bad condition.

so let's say we survived the pandemic's start and let' say we successfully destroyed the 'weak' and we also have stored food and water for those 200 days (we got big storing space that's in living part) are there cons of this 'tactic' i mean during pandemic everything can happen but let's say our food is good, there's no electricity and there's few dozens of zombies outside the plot. even let's say nothing bad happen during those 200 days what now? what else can we do after surviving like 98% of civilization. do we just starve? what is the point of surviving 200 days with risk everywhere with no weapons ( by weapons i mean things more like guns. we could use only hammers and knifes if something happen ) is it better than surviving those 3 days or less? zombies surly would get weaker after like 140 days with small amounts of food but they would still exist. what civilization will become? small groups of people that will do anything to survive? we still won't have chances, even after those 200 days or even year or so. 

it's my first post here. 

comment what do you think about that if it's worth it. thanks for reading."

Why does nobody consider the benefits of spears and long range melee weaponry?,"When you actually think about it, spears are the most practical and effective weaponry in a zombie apocalypse situation no matter where you have to hit to kill those undead shamblers.

Zpoc Ideas #001,"Basic home defense ideas for early stages of outbreak.
 
NAILBOARDS: 
Nail boards can be an essential home defense tool. You could put them across entry roads to prevent mounted approach from hostiles. Covered in leaves for concealment and put them around key defensive positions. Can be built easily and require next to no materials besides a plank of wood and some nails. They can easily cause a flat tire and will surely slow down anyone approaching on foot.

BOARDED WINDOWS:
Board up every window in the house or building. Make sure to leave peek holes in every window that can be covered from the inside. If the building is two story the leave a window in boarded aiming towards key defensive points, such as the road/driveway, any major flanks around compound.

CALTROPS:
Caltrops are really good at puncturing tires and slowing anyone with no boots on. They are decently easy to make but require little skill using power tools.

GUARD DUTY: 
This one's simple, just always have someone on watch for danger. Everyone in the group who are able participate. Shifts change every 3 hours.

LOCKS:
Just put extra locks on your doors and windows. One at the top of the door and one at the bottom. 
Deadbolts preferred.

nailboards: 
nail boards can be an essential home defense tool. you could put them across entry roads to prevent mounted approach from hostiles. covered in leaves for concealment and put them around key defensive positions. can be built easily and require next to no materials besides a plank of wood and some nails. they can easily cause a flat tire and will surely slow down anyone approaching on foot.

boarded windows:
board up every window in the house or building. make sure to leave peek holes in every window that can be covered from the inside. if the building is two story the leave a window in boarded aiming towards key defensive points, such as the road/driveway, any major flanks around compound.

caltrops:
caltrops are really good at puncturing tires and slowing anyone with no boots on. they are decently easy to make but require little skill using power tools.

If they are roaming in droves down city streets then spray them with kerosene from above and light a match!  💥 💥
